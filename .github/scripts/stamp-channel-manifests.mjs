#!/usr/bin/env node
// Stamps every channel-released manifest in the CI checkout with its DERIVED
// version for the current branch, and rewrites internal ranges to match — the
// publish-time half of the channel-promotion scheme (see npm-channel.mjs).
//
// Two rewrites per manifest:
//   - version: base X.Y.Z-dev.N -> the channel's derived version
//   - dependencies/peerDependencies/optionalDependencies ranges pointing at
//     OTHER channel-released packages -> ^<that package's derived version>
//     (devDependencies are not shipped; `workspace:*`, `file:` and `*` ranges
//     are left for the existing rewrite-file-deps.mjs / npm semantics)
//
// Stamping the WHOLE family at once (not just the package being packed) keeps
// every later reader consistent: rewrite-file-deps.mjs pins `file:` deps from
// the referenced manifest's (now derived) version, and
// stamp-template-versions.mjs reads the (now derived) miniapp/miniapp-cli
// versions for the scaffolder template.
//
// Mutates the checkout that gets packed/published — NEVER committed. Run it
// AFTER `bun install` (a frozen install would reject the changed version
// fields) and before pack/publish.
//
// Usage: node stamp-channel-manifests.mjs   (branch from GITHUB_REF_NAME)
