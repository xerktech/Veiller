  //      path: the user is right beside the destination (perpendicular to it)
  //      with only a few meters of straight-line distance, but the route
  //      polyline still continues, so the along-route check alone would not
  //      fire. The "near the route end" gate is what keeps a route that merely
  //      passes close to the pin mid-trip (e.g. loops back to the real
  //      entrance) from arriving early.
