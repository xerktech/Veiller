/**
 * Local ESLint flat-config override.
 *
 * The workspace eslint config wires `eslint-import-resolver-typescript` to
 * `./mobile/tsconfig.json` + `./cloud/tsconfig.json`, so it can't see the
 * `@/*` path alias declared in this folder's tsconfig.json. Without this
 * override, `import {X} from "@/..."` lights up "Unable to resolve" even
 * though TS itself resolves fine.
 *
 * We extend the workspace config and add our tsconfig to the resolver
 * project list. No rule changes — only resolver wiring.
