# Notification listener ANRs by cold-starting React Native (OS-1821)

Reproduced 2026-07-29 on a moto g play 2024 (Android 14, API 34), Mentra 2.12.0.
This is the crash behind the "emergency kill switch" in PR #3562, which disabled
the Android notification listener by default and has blocked OS-1821 since.

This document records both the reproduced root cause and the native isolation
implemented to remove it.

## The ANR

```
Process:  com.mentra.mentra
Subject:  executing service com.mentra.mentra/
          com.mentra.crust.services.NotificationListenerServiceImpl, InvisibleToUser
Build:    motorola/fogona_g/fogona:14/U1TFS34.100-35-14-1-16
Foreground: No
Process-Runtime: 42057
```

`InvisibleToUser` means a background ANR: no dialog, no app-visible crash, the
system just kills the process. That is why the report in PR #3562 said the
uploaded logs "ended before the failure" — there is nothing for the app to log.

Main thread at the moment of the ANR:

```
MainApplication.onCreate(MainApplication.kt:37)
 └─ ReactNativeApplicationEntryPoint.loadReactNative
     └─ DefaultNewArchitectureEntryPoint.load
         └─ ReactNativeFeatureFlagsCxxInterop.<clinit>
             └─ SoLoader.loadLibrary
                 └─ DirectApkSoSource.loadDependencies → buildLibDepsCache
                     └─ new ZipFile(...) → ZipFile$Source.initCEN   ← stuck here
```

System state in the same record:

```
/proc/pressure/cpu     some avg10=86.53
/proc/pressure/memory  some avg10=26.86   full avg10=5.40
CPU usage: 93% TOTAL
  51% 103/kswapd0: 0% user + 51% kernel
RssKb: 191596   VmSwapKb: 21244
```

`kswapd0` burning 51% of CPU in kernel is the kernel thrashing to reclaim pages.
The device is RAM-starved and swapping.

## What is actually happening

Before the fix, a notification arriving while the Mentra App was **not running**
made Android start the process specifically to deliver it. Because
`NotificationListenerServiceImpl` lived in the main process,
`Application.onCreate` ran first — booting the entire React Native runtime,
including SoLoader opening the APK and parsing its zip central directory to
build a native-library dependency cache.

All of that has to finish inside the service-start ANR window. On a fast phone it
does. On a budget device under memory pressure it does not, and the system kills
the process.

The notification listener does not need React Native. It is Kotlin; it reads the
notification and hands it off. RN is being dragged in purely because the service
shares a process with the app.

## Why this explains the original report

| Observation                                   | Explanation                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Crashes when he gets a lot of notifications" | Each notification arriving at a dead process is another cold start, and another chance to exceed the window. Volume raises the odds; it is not the cause.  |
| Logs ended before the failure                 | Background ANR: silent kill, no stack trace in app logs.                                                                                                   |
| The kill switch worked                        | A disabled component is never bound, so notifications never wake the process, so there is no cold start to time out.                                       |
| Pixel 8 and Z Fold 6 never reproduced         | Both are fast flagships on API 36. 250-notification bursts on each survived with no ANR. This is a low-RAM device problem, not an Android-version problem. |
| Only some users                               | Depends on device class and on whether the app happens to be dead when notifications land.                                                                 |

## Fix implemented

The listener now runs in its own process:

```xml
<service
  android:name="com.mentra.crust.services.NotificationListenerServiceImpl"
  android:process=":notif"
  ... />
```

Android still creates the configured `Application` in every process, so the
process declaration is not sufficient on its own. The Crust config plugin also
injects a `MainApplication.onCreate` guard that returns immediately in `:notif`,
before `loadReactNative()`. `NotificationProcess` deliberately has no Expo or
React dependencies, keeping that path cheap.

`NotificationListener` hands events to the live app process through a
signature-protected package broadcast. Its receiving side is registered
dynamically by `CrustModule`; therefore a notification can reach JS while the app
runtime is alive, but cannot cold-start the main process while it is dead. There
are no running miniapps to receive an event in a dead app process, so events are
not queued for a later session.

Notification configuration uses a second explicit broadcast into `:notif`.
That is necessary because Android caches `SharedPreferences` per process. The
receiver commits the payload inside `:notif` before updating the live listener,
so a later service recreation reads the same process-local config. Ordinary
blocklist changes update the listener without rebinding it; the confirmed
permission-grant path requests its rebind only after that local commit.

With this isolation in place, listening is desired by default again. Native code
keeps the component enabled so it remains discoverable in Android's
notification-access Settings, but does not rebind the service or start `:notif`
until access is granted. Opening Notify (or another miniapp that requires
`READ_NOTIFICATIONS`) runs the permission flow, and the successful post-Settings
grant explicitly rebinds the listener immediately. Routine permission checks are
read-only and never restart the service.
`android_notification_listener_enabled` remains available in Debug Settings as
an emergency kill switch.

## Secondary hardening (independent of the above)

The same change also:

1. Guards both `requestRebind()` calls, including the one that can race
   notification-access revocation.
2. Moves `getApplicationInfo` + `getApplicationLabel` off the service callback
   thread and caches labels by package. This measured ~16ms per notification on
   a Pixel 8 before the fix.

One non-blocking discrepancy remains: **`android:exported="false"`** on the service is non-standard for a
`NotificationListenerService`; Google's documented sample uses `exported="true"`
and relies on `BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE` to restrict binding. It
demonstrably works on API 36, so this is tidiness, not a known break.

## Verifying a fix

1. Budget Android device (the moto g play 2024 reproduces; flagships do not).
2. Force-stop the Mentra App so the process is dead.
3. Post notifications: `adb shell cmd notification post -t T tag body`.
4. Watch for death: `adb shell pidof com.mentra.mentra`.
5. Check for a new record: `adb shell dumpsys dropbox --print data_app_anr | grep -A5 mentra`.

A fix means step 5 stays empty while notifications still arrive.

## Note on telemetry

None of this reached Sentry, and would not have. Every mobile CI workflow runs
`cp .env.example .env`, and that file ships `EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` empty;
`SentrySetup.tsx` returns early on an empty DSN without logging. So CI builds
have crash reporting silently disabled. Being tracked separately — it is the
reason this took a device-side ANR dump to find.
