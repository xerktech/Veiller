## Problem Statement

The OTA update system is fragile. Users experience stuck screens, phantom countdowns, and confusing multi-phase UI. Engineers struggle to test the flow because it requires installing old firmware every time.

**Core issues:**

- The phone tries to orchestrate an update it can't reliably observe.
- `ota_progress` events (including critical `FINISHED`/`FAILED`) are sent over unreliable BLE with no ACK/retry.
- There is no mechanism for the phone to query the glasses' OTA state after a BLE reconnect.
- The glasses app process is killed during APK install, losing all in-memory OTA state.
- The user sees 14 distinct screens/states for a 3-step update (APK + MTK + BES).

### State Tracking

| What            | Phone                                                        | Glasses                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Update sequence | `updateSequenceRef` (frozen from first `otaUpdateAvailable`) | Parsed from version manifest on each `ota_start`   |
| Current step    | `currentUpdateIndex` (0, 1, 2)                               | `currentUpdateType` (mutable string, can be stale) |
| Progress        | `otaProgress` in Zustand store                               | Not persisted; in-memory only                      |
| Phase           | `progressState` (8 enum values, 9+ transitions)              | Not tracked as explicit state                      |
| Session         | No session concept                                           | No session concept                                 |

### Communication

| Message                   | Direction        | Delivery                                  | ACK/Retry                                       |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `ota_start`               | Phone → Glasses  | BLE with `mId` + ACK tracking             | Yes (phone retries 3x at 5s)                    |
| `ota_start_ack`           | Glasses → Phone  | Raw BLE `sendData`                        | No                                              |
| `ota_progress`            | Glasses → Phone  | Raw BLE `sendData`                        | No                                              |
| `mtk_update_complete`     | Glasses → Phone  | `reliableManager.sendMessage`             | Attempted, but type not in `RELIABLE_TYPES` set |
| `sr_adota` (BES progress) | BES chip → Phone | BLE characteristic (bypasses glasses app) | No                                              |

### Phone UI States

For a 3-step update, the user sees:

1. "Checking for updates..." (check screen)
2. "Update Available" (check screen)
3. "Starting Update" (progress — spinner)
4. "Downloading Update..." (progress — APK with %)
5. "Installing Update..." (progress — APK, no %)
6. "Starting Update" (progress — spinner, AGAIN)
7. "Installing Update..." (progress — MTK with %)
8. "Starting Update" (progress — spinner, AGAIN)
9. "Downloading Update..." (progress — BES, spinner)
10. "Installing Update..." (progress — BES with %)
11. "Update Installed" (restarting — Continue disabled 15s)
12. "All Updates Installed" (completed)
13. "Checking for updates..." (re-verification)
14. "Up to Date" (check screen)

---

## Root Causes

### 1. No Persistent OTA Session on Glasses

The glasses process updates in `processAppsSequentially()` on a single thread, but APK install kills the process. After restart, there is no record of the in-progress multi-step OTA. The phone must re-trigger each step with a fresh `ota_start`.

### 2. No State Query Mechanism

After any BLE disconnect (including expected reboots during MTK/BES), the phone has no way to ask the glasses "what step are you on?" It must infer from version numbers, build number changes, and incoming progress events.

### 3. Unreliable Delivery for Critical Events

`ota_progress` (including `FINISHED` and `FAILED`) is sent via raw `sendData` — no ACK, no retry. If a `FINISHED` event is dropped:

- **APK**: Phone can detect build number change (backup path works).
- **MTK**: `mtk_update_complete` event exists but the handler on the phone (`waitingForMtkComplete`) is dead code — never set to `true`.
- **BES**: No backup. Phone times out after 120s and shows "failed" even if BES succeeded.

### 4. Download Suppression Hides Failures

`sendProgressToPhone()` in `OtaHelper.java` line 2471-2473 suppresses ALL download-stage events for MTK and BES, including `FAILED`. The phone never learns about firmware download failures.

### 5. Phone Over-Orchestrates

The phone's `progress.tsx` (1,900 lines) runs 8+ concurrent timers, maintains multiple refs for reconnection gating, and uses two event systems (Zustand store + GlobalEventEmitter) to reconstruct what the glasses are doing. This complexity is the source of most UI bugs (stale closures, race conditions, stuck states).

### 6. Three Different Progress Paths

- APK: Direct `sendProgressToPhone()` calls
- MTK: System broadcast → `MtkOtaReceiver` → EventBus → `OtaService` → `sendMtkInstallProgressToPhone()`
- BES: BES chip → `sr_adota` via BLE → `MentraLive` conversion → `ota_progress` event

The phone must understand all three paths and stitch them into a coherent UI.

## Known Bugs (Pre-existing)

These bugs exist in the current codebase and should be fixed regardless of the rearchitecture. Items marked with `[R]` are resolved by the rearchitecture; items marked with `[I]` should be fixed independently.

### Critical (UI gets stuck)

| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | BLE disconnect during APK install leaves UI stuck on "Installing..." — neither `disconnected` nor `restarting` branch fires when `currentUpdate === "apk"` | `progress.tsx` lines 811-841               | Add branch: `installing` + not mtk/bes → `disconnected`                                           | `[R]` Eliminated by simplified progress screen        |

| 3   | Connection overlay covers OTA during expected reboots (MTK/BES) — "Stop trying" button aborts the flow                                                     | `ConnectionOverlayContext.tsx` lines 65-90 | Expose `suppressOverlay` flag from progress screen when in `restarting`/`installing` with MTK/BES | `[I]` Fix independently                               |
| 4   | Stale progress regression guard blocks new OTA sessions — `setOtaProgress` clamps 0% to previous session's 100%                                            | `glasses.ts` lines 149-167                 | Reset `otaProgress` at session start                                                              | `[R]` Eliminated — `otaStatus` replaces `otaProgress` |

### High (wrong decisions / misleading UX)

## Target Architecture

### Principles

1. **Glasses are the source of truth.** The glasses own the update sequence, track the current step, persist state across restarts, and report a unified status.
2. **Phone is a display terminal.** The phone shows progress, handles user input (start, retry, cancel), and converts BES `sr_adota` into the status format. It does not orchestrate steps.
3. **One message type, one progress bar.** The user sees a single overall percentage that monotonically increases. Internal details (APK vs MTK vs BES, download vs install) are hidden.
4. **Query on reconnect.** After any BLE disconnect, the phone asks the glasses for current status. No inference, no guessing.
5. **Reliable delivery for terminal events.** `FINISHED` and `FAILED` use ACK/retry. Intermediate progress can be lossy.

### Phone UI States (New)

For a 3-step update, the user sees:

1. "Update Available" — tap Update Now
2. "Updating... 34%" — real progress bar, "Step 1 of 3" in small text
3. Brief "Reconnecting..." overlay during expected reboots
4. "All Updates Complete" — tap Continue

**4 screens. 1 progress bar.**

---

## Detailed Design

### A. Glasses: OTA Session Persistence

**New class:** `OtaSessionManager.java`

**SharedPreferences key:** `"ota_session"`

**Persisted fields:**

```json
{
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "total_steps": 3,
  "step_sequence": ["apk", "mtk", "bes"],
  "current_step_index": 0,
  "current_phase": "download",
  "step_percent": 0,
  "status": "in_progress",
  "error_message": null,
  "version_json_url": "https://...",
  "last_activity_at_elapsed": 123456789,
  "restarting_since_elapsed": null
}
```

**Write points:**

- On `ota_start` received: create session with full step list from version manifest. If an active session already exists, resume it instead of creating a new one (see Edge Case: `ota_start` vs `ota_query_status` race below).
- Before each step begins: update `current_step_index` and `current_phase`
- On progress updates: update `step_percent` (throttled, every 5%)
- On step completion: increment `current_step_index`, reset `step_percent` to 0, update `last_activity_at_elapsed`
- On session end (all complete or fatal failure): clear session
- Before APK install: set `restarting_since_elapsed` to current `elapsedRealtime()`, then persist session (install kills the process)

**Read points:**

- On `ota_query_status`: return current session state
- On app restart in `OtaService.checkAndResumeAfterApkUpdate()`: check for active session

**Timestamps — use monotonic clock:** All timestamps in the session use `SystemClock.elapsedRealtime()` (milliseconds since boot), **not** `System.currentTimeMillis()`. This is critical because Mentra Live syncs its system clock with the internet after connecting to WiFi — if we used wall-clock time, a session created before NTP sync would have a timestamp hours or years in the past, and would appear "expired" the moment the clock jumps forward after sync. `elapsedRealtime()` is monotonic and unaffected by NTP sync or user clock changes.

**Caveat:** `elapsedRealtime()` resets on device reboot. OTA sessions don't survive full reboots (only APK install restarts), so this is acceptable. For the APK restart path specifically, see the restart guard below.

**Session expiry:** If `last_activity_at_elapsed` is more than 30 minutes older than current `SystemClock.elapsedRealtime()`, consider the session stale and clear it. Expiry is based on last activity (step completion, progress update) — not session creation time. This prevents long multi-step updates from expiring mid-flow while still cleaning up zombie sessions.

**APK restart guard:** Before APK install, set `restarting_since_elapsed` to current `SystemClock.elapsedRealtime()`. On app restart, if `restarting_since_elapsed` is set, **skip the normal expiry check** (since `elapsedRealtime()` may have reset across the process kill) and instead just enforce the 10-second delay: if the session's `restarting_since_elapsed` is set, wait 10 seconds from process start before auto-continuing. After the wait, clear `restarting_since_elapsed` and proceed. This prevents the edge case where the old process hasn't fully died yet when the new process starts.

**Session locking:** `ota_start` must check `hasActiveSession()` before creating a new session. The behavior depends on the session's current status:

```java
if (sessionManager.hasActiveSession()) {
    String status = sessionManager.getStatus();
    if ("failed".equals(status) || "complete".equals(status)) {
        // Terminal state — clear stale session and start fresh
        sessionManager.clear();
        // Fall through to create new session below
    } else {
        // In-progress session — resume, don't restart
        sendOtaStatus(sessionManager.getCurrentStatus());
        return;
    }
}
// Create new session from version manifest
sessionManager.createSession(stepSequence, versionJsonUrl);
```

This prevents duplicate APK installs if the phone sends `ota_start` while a session is mid-flight, while still allowing the user to retry after a failure (failed sessions are cleared on the next `ota_start`). "Retry" on the phone always sends `ota_start` — no separate `ota_resume` command is needed.

### B. Glasses: Unified `ota_status` Message

**New method:** `sendOtaStatus()` in `OtaHelper.java`

**JSON payload:**

```json
{
  "type": "ota_status",
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "total_steps": 3,
  "current_step": 2,
  "step_type": "mtk",
  "phase": "install",
  "step_percent": 60,
  "overall_percent": 53,
  "status": "in_progress",
  "error_message": null
}
```

**`status` enum values:** `"in_progress"`, `"step_complete"`, `"complete"`, `"failed"`, `"idle"`

**Overall percent computation:**

Each step gets equal weight: `stepWeight = 100 / totalSteps`.

Within a step, download phase is 40% of step weight, install phase is 60%.

```java
int computeOverallPercent(int stepIndex, int totalSteps, String phase, int stepPercent) {
    double stepWeight = 100.0 / totalSteps;
    double completedWeight = stepIndex * stepWeight;
    double phaseWeight = "download".equals(phase) ? 0.4 : 1.0;
    double phaseBase = "install".equals(phase) ? 0.4 * stepWeight : 0;
    return (int)(completedWeight + phaseBase + phaseWeight * stepWeight * stepPercent / 100.0);
}
```

**Cache-hit optimization:** When a firmware download is cached, the download phase can be skipped — but only after validation. Before skipping, the glasses must:

1. Check cached file exists on disk
2. Validate file size against expected size (stored `Content-Length` from the original download, or `expectedSizeBytes` from the version manifest)
3. If valid → skip download phase, jump straight to install
4. If invalid or missing → delete cached file, proceed with full download

This ordering ensures the cache-skip optimization never bypasses the corruption check described in EC-1.

**Delivery:**

- `status` values `"in_progress"` with intermediate `step_percent`: unreliable (raw `sendData`), throttled every 2s or 5%
- `status` values `"step_complete"`, `"complete"`, `"failed"`: reliable (`ReliableMessageManager`)
- The `ota_status` type must be added to `MessageReliability.RELIABLE_TYPES`

**Backwards compatibility:** Send both `ota_progress` (old format) and `ota_status` (new format) during a transition period. The phone checks for `ota_status` first.

### C. Glasses: `ota_query_status` Handler

**New handler** in `OtaCommandHandler.java`.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "type": "ota_query_status"
}
```

**Response:** Glasses reads `OtaSessionManager` and sends an `ota_status` message. If no session is active:

```json
{
  "type": "ota_status",
  "status": "idle"
}
```

Sent via `ReliableMessageManager` (important — this is a response to a query, not a periodic update).

### D. Glasses: Auto-Continue After APK Restart

**Modified:** `OtaService.checkAndResumeAfterApkUpdate()`

Currently it starts a background prefetch. New behavior:

```java
OtaSessionManager session = new OtaSessionManager(this);
if (session.hasActiveSession()) {
    // Active OTA session found — auto-continue
    otaHelper.setPhoneInitiatedOta(true);
    otaHelper.startVersionCheckWithUrl(this, session.getVersionJsonUrl());
} else if (currentVersion > previousVersion) {
    // Version bumped but no session — just prefetch
    otaHelper.startVersionCheck(this);
}
```

Since Phase 0 pre-downloads firmware before APK install, the cache should be warm. The glasses skip the download phase and go straight to install.

### E. Glasses: Fix Download Suppression

**Modified:** `OtaHelper.sendProgressToPhone()` line 2471-2473

```java
// Before:
if ("download".equals(stage) && ("bes".equals(currentUpdateType) || "mtk".equals(currentUpdateType))) {
    return;
}

// After:
if ("download".equals(stage)
    && ("bes".equals(currentUpdateType) || "mtk".equals(currentUpdateType))
    && !"FAILED".equals(status)
    && !"FINISHED".equals(status)) {
    return;
}
```

This applies to both old `ota_progress` and the new `sendOtaStatus()` path.

### F. Glasses: Firmware Download Retry

**Modified:** `OtaHelper.java`

Extract retry logic from `downloadApk` into a shared `downloadWithRetry(url, outputFile, connectTimeoutMs, readTimeoutMs, maxRetries, retryDelayMs)` method.

Apply to `downloadMtkFirmware` and `downloadBesFirmware` with 2 retries and 10s delay.

### F2. Glasses: Pre-flight Internet Reachability Check

**Modified:** `OtaHelper.java`

Before starting any downloads, perform a lightweight internet reachability check. This catches "WiFi connected but no internet" (e.g., captive portals, hotspots without upstream, misconfigured networks) within seconds instead of waiting for download timeouts.

```java
private static final int REACHABILITY_TIMEOUT_MS = 5000;

private boolean checkInternetReachable() {
    try {
        HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection)
            new URL("https://cdn.mentra.glass/ping").openConnection();
        conn.setConnectTimeout(REACHABILITY_TIMEOUT_MS);
        conn.setReadTimeout(REACHABILITY_TIMEOUT_MS);
        conn.setRequestMethod("HEAD");
        conn.connect();
        int code = conn.getResponseCode();
        conn.disconnect();
        return code >= 200 && code < 400;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        Log.w(TAG, "Internet reachability check failed: " + e.getMessage());
        return false;
    }
}
```

**Call site:** At the start of `startOtaFromPhone()`, before creating the OTA session. If `checkInternetReachable()` returns `false`:

- Send `ota_status` with `status: "failed"` and `error_message: "no_internet"`
- Do not create a session or begin downloads
- The phone shows a specific "WiFi has no internet" error screen with options to change WiFi or retry

**Fallback:** If the reachability endpoint is unreachable but downloads succeed (e.g., endpoint is down but CDN works), this is a false negative. To handle this, also apply the semantic error classification in F3 below — so even if the pre-flight check is skipped or passes, download failures still get actionable error messages.

### F3. Glasses: Semantic Download Error Classification

**Modified:** `OtaHelper.java` — download catch blocks

When a download fails, classify the exception type into a semantic error code included in the `ota_status` `error_message`:

```java
private String classifyDownloadError(Exception e) {
    if (e instanceof java.net.SocketTimeoutException) {
        return "no_internet";       // timeout → likely no connectivity
    } else if (e instanceof java.net.UnknownHostException) {
        return "no_internet";       // DNS failure → no internet
    } else if (e instanceof java.net.ConnectException) {
        return "no_internet";       // connection refused → no route
    } else if (e instanceof javax.net.ssl.SSLException) {
        return "ssl_error";         // certificate / TLS issue
    } else {
        return "download_failed";   // generic fallback
    }
}
```

**Phone-side handling:** The `progress.tsx` rewrite (Section N) maps these error codes to user-facing messages:

| `error_message`     | Phone UI                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `"no_internet"`     | "Glasses are connected to WiFi but can't reach the internet. Try a different network." + "Change WiFi" / "Retry" buttons |
| `"ssl_error"`       | "Secure connection failed. This can happen on public WiFi with captive portals. Try a different network."                |
| `"download_failed"` | Generic "Update failed. Tap Retry to try again."                                                                         |

This ensures the user gets actionable guidance regardless of whether the pre-flight check (F2) caught the issue.

### G. Glasses: BES Reliability Fixes

**Modified:** `BesOtaManager.java`

1. **Segment verify failure (line 714-716):** Add `cleanup()` after posting `createFailed`.
2. **`send()` failure during data transfer (line 767-769):** Post `BesOtaProgressEvent.createFailed(...)` and call `cleanup()`.
3. **Wakelock (line 33-34):** Increase `WAKELOCK_TIMEOUT_MS` from 120s to 300s (5 min).
4. **`FileInputStream.available()` (line 199):** Replace with `File.length()` for reliable file size.
5. **Total operation timeout:** Add a `BES_TOTAL_TIMEOUT_MS = 300_000` (5 min) guard. Record `startTime` when `startFirmwareUpdate()` is called. In `dealOtaRecvCmd()`, before processing each UART response, check if `System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime > BES_TOTAL_TIMEOUT_MS`. If exceeded, call `cleanup()` and post `BesOtaProgressEvent.createFailed("BES firmware update timeout — chip may be unresponsive")`. This prevents the glasses from holding a wakelock forever if the BES chip hangs mid-protocol (e.g., stops responding after `SetStartInfo`).

### H. Glasses: Wakelock on Queued Install

**Modified:** `OtaHelper.startOtaFromPhone()` lines 454-461

Acquire wakelock before returning from the queued path:

```java
if (versionCheckLock.isLocked()) {
    pendingPhoneInstall = true;
    suppressPhoneProgress = false;
    isPhoneInitiatedOta = true;
    WakeLockManager.acquireCpuWakeLock(context, OTA_WAKELOCK_TIMEOUT_MS);  // ADD THIS
    sendProgressToPhone("download", 0, 0, 0, "STARTED", null);
    return;
}
```

### I. Phone Native Bridge: Android (`MentraLive.java`)

1. **New method:** `sendOtaQueryStatus()` — sends `{"type": "ota_query_status"}` to glasses via `sendJson`.
2. **New event listener:** Handle incoming `ota_status` messages. Forward to React Native as `"ota_status"` event with camelCase field mapping.
3. **`sr_adota` handler modification:** When converting BES progress to events, also emit as `ota_status` format using cached session info (last known `totalSteps`, `currentStep`) from the most recent `ota_status` received.

### J. Phone Native Bridge: iOS (`MentraLive.swift`)

Same changes as Android:

1. `sendOtaQueryStatus()` method
2. `ota_status` event forwarding
3. `sr_adota` → `ota_status` merging

### K. Phone Bridge Types (`Core.types.ts`, `CoreModule.ts`)

```typescript
export interface OtaStatus {
  sessionId: string
  totalSteps: number
  currentStep: number      // 1-indexed for display
  stepType: 'apk' | 'mtk' | 'bes'
  phase: 'download' | 'install'
  stepPercent: number      // 0-100
  overallPercent: number   // 0-100
  status: 'in_progress' | 'step_complete' | 'complete' | 'failed' | 'idle'
  error?: string
}

// New method on CoreModule
sendOtaQueryStatus(): void
```

### L. Phone Store (`glasses.ts`)

Replace `otaProgress` / `otaInProgress` with:

```typescript
otaStatus: OtaStatus | null
setOtaStatus: (status: OtaStatus | null) => void
```

No regression guard needed — `overallPercent` is computed by the glasses and guaranteed monotonic.

`clearOtaState` clears `otaStatus` to `null`.

### M. Phone Events (`MantleManager.ts`)

Add handler for `ota_status` events:

```typescript
CoreModule.addListener("ota_status", (event) => {
  const status: OtaStatus = {
    sessionId: event.session_id,
    totalSteps: event.total_steps,
    currentStep: event.current_step,
    stepType: event.step_type,
    phase: event.phase,
    stepPercent: event.step_percent,
    overallPercent: event.overall_percent,
    status: event.status,
    error: event.error_message,
  }
  useGlassesStore.getState().setOtaStatus(status)
  GlobalEventEmitter.emit("ota_status", status)

  if (status.status === "complete" || status.status === "failed") {
    useGlassesStore.getState().setOtaUpdateAvailable(null)
  }
})
```

Keep existing `ota_progress` handler for backwards compatibility with older glasses firmware.

### N. Phone UI: `progress.tsx` Rewrite

Replace the current 1,900-line file with ~200-300 lines.

**States:** `'starting' | 'updating' | 'complete' | 'failed' | 'disconnected'`

**Logic:**

```typescript
const otaStatus = useGlassesStore((s) => s.otaStatus)
const connected = useGlassesStore((s) => s.connected)
const [state, setState] = useState<ProgressState>("starting")
const [lastPercent, setLastPercent] = useState(0)
const lastStatusTime = useRef(Date.now())
const sessionStarted = useRef(false)

// On mount or reconnect: start or resume
useEffect(() => {
  if (!connected) return

  if (otaStatus?.status === "in_progress" || otaStatus?.status === "step_complete") {
    // Session already active (e.g., app relaunched mid-update) — query, don't restart
    CoreModule.sendOtaQueryStatus()
    sessionStarted.current = true
  } else if (!sessionStarted.current) {
    // No active session — start fresh
    CoreModule.sendOtaStart()
    sessionStarted.current = true
  } else {
    // Session was started by us, reconnecting after BLE drop — query current state
    CoreModule.sendOtaQueryStatus()
  }
}, [connected])

// React to status updates
useEffect(() => {
  if (!otaStatus) return
  lastStatusTime.current = Date.now()

  switch (otaStatus.status) {
    case "complete":
      setState("complete")
      break
    case "failed":
      setState("failed")
      break
    case "in_progress":
    case "step_complete":
      setState("updating")
      setLastPercent(otaStatus.overallPercent)
      break
    case "idle":
      // Glasses say no OTA active — might have completed while disconnected
      setState("complete")
      break
  }
}, [otaStatus])

// Single timeout: no status update in 2 min → failed
useEffect(() => {
  if (state !== "starting" && state !== "updating") return
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    setState("failed")
  }, 120_000)
  return () => clearTimeout(timer)
}, [state, otaStatus])
```

**Render:**

- `starting`: Icon + "Starting Update" + spinner + "Do not disconnect"
- `updating`: Icon + "Updating..." + **progress bar** at `lastPercent%` + "Step N of M" (dim) + elapsed time
- `complete`: Check icon + "All Updates Complete" / "Update Complete" + Continue button
- `failed`: Warning icon + "Update Failed" + error message + Retry / Change WiFi buttons
- `disconnected`: Bluetooth icon + "Update Interrupted" + Retry button

**Eliminated:**

- `currentUpdateIndex`, `advanceToNextStep`, `sendOtaStartCommand` retry loop
- 8 concurrent timers (replaced by 1)
- `waitingForReconnectRef`, `hasSentOtaStartMidSequenceRef`
- Revalidation effect
- `expectedStep` vs `currentUpdate` mismatch logic
- MTK stall simulation
- Build number detection as APK completion backup
- `otaProgress` → `progressState` translation layer
- Cover video trigger logic (can be simplified to "show on first `updating` state")
- `ota_start_ack` / `mtk_update_complete` / `GlobalEventEmitter` listeners

### O. Phone UI: Connection Overlay Fix

**Modified:** `ConnectionOverlayContext.tsx`

Regardless of rearchitecture, fix the overlay to not cover OTA during expected reboots:

- Add `suppressOverlay` to `useConnectionOverlayConfig`
- `progress.tsx` sets `suppressOverlay: true` when `state === 'updating'` and `otaStatus?.stepType` is `'mtk'` or `'bes'` and `otaStatus?.phase === 'install'`
- The overlay checks this flag and stays hidden

### P. Phone Effects: `OtaUpdateChecker.tsx`

Simplify: after glasses connect and version info arrives, check `otaStatus?.status`. If `'in_progress'`, don't show the "update available" alert (the user is already updating). If `'idle'`, proceed with normal check logic.

Fix the stale `connected` bug: re-read from `useGlassesStore.getState().connected` after `await waitForGlassesState`.

---

## Migration & Backwards Compatibility

### Phase 1: Glasses ships first

1. Glasses sends BOTH `ota_progress` (old) and `ota_status` (new) for every progress event.
2. Glasses adds `ota_query_status` handler.
3. Glasses persists OTA session and auto-continues after APK restart.
4. Old phone app ignores `ota_status` (unknown event type) and works as before.
5. No breaking changes.

### Phase 2: Phone ships

1. Phone checks glasses firmware version (from `version_info`).
2. If glasses supports `ota_status` (firmware >= threshold): use new simplified `progress.tsx`.
3. If glasses is old: fall back to current `progress.tsx` (kept as `progress-legacy.tsx`).
4. Feature flag: `useNewOtaFlow` based on glasses firmware version.

### Permanent: Dual-Send Stays

Dual-send of `ota_progress` + `ota_status` from glasses is intentionally permanent. Old glasses in the field will continue sending only `ota_progress`, and the phone must support both formats indefinitely. `progress-legacy.tsx` and the old `otaProgress` / `otaInProgress` store fields remain in the codebase for backwards compatibility.

- [ ] Connection overlay suppression during OTA (ConnectionOverlayContext.tsx)
- [ ] Fix check-for-updates dependency array (check-for-updates.tsx)
- [ ] Fix stale connected in OtaUpdateChecker (OtaUpdateChecker.tsx)

### Phone — Rearchitecture

- [ ] Add `sendOtaQueryStatus()` to native bridges (Android + iOS)
- [ ] Add `ota_status` event handling to native bridges
- [ ] Merge `sr_adota` BES progress into `ota_status` format in native bridges
- [ ] Add `OtaStatus` types to `Core.types.ts`
- [ ] Add `otaStatus` to glasses store (keep `otaProgress` permanently for legacy)

- [ ] Add firmware version gating (new vs legacy progress screen)
- [ ] Simplify `OtaUpdateChecker.tsx` to use `otaStatus`

### Testing

- [ ] Test: full 3-step OTA with new glasses + new phone
- [ ] Test: new glasses + old phone (verify backwards compat via dual-send)
- [ ] Test: old glasses + new phone (verify legacy fallback via version gating)
- [ ] Test: BLE drop mid-update → reconnect → `ota_query_status` resync
- [ ] Test: WiFi with no internet → pre-flight check → "no internet" error

### Future Tech Debt

- [ ] Re-enable APK SHA256 verification when manifest supports hashes

**Note:** Dual-send of `ota_progress` + `ota_status` from glasses is intentionally permanent. Old glasses in the field will continue sending only `ota_progress`, and the phone must support both formats indefinitely. `progress-legacy.tsx` and the old `otaProgress` / `otaInProgress` store fields remain in the codebase for backwards compatibility.

## Edge Cases (Must Handle)

These edge cases are realistic field conditions that the rearchitecture must address. Each is mapped to the design section that handles it.

### EC-1: Corrupted Download Cache

**Scenario:** Glasses download an APK, phone disconnects mid-write, file is half-written but exists on disk. On retry, `pruneOneCacheEntry()` sees the file exists and skips re-download. APK install fails with a corrupted package.

**Mitigation (Section A + Bug #19):**

- On `ota_start`, validate cached files before considering them "complete." Check file size against the expected size from the version manifest (the manifest already contains `updateUrl` — add `expectedSizeBytes` to the manifest or use HTTP `Content-Length` stored during download).
- If validation fails, delete the cached file and re-download.
- Long-term: when the manifest supports SHA256 hashes, verify integrity before install.

### EC-2: `ota_start` vs `ota_query_status` Race

**Scenario:** Phone sends `ota_start`, glasses begin APK download. BLE drops briefly. Phone reconnects and fires both `ota_query_status` (from the reconnect effect) and potentially another `ota_start` (if the user navigated back and re-entered the progress screen). The glasses receive `ota_start` while already mid-session, reset to step 1, and trigger a duplicate APK download/install.

**Mitigation (Section A — Session locking):**

- `OtaCommandHandler` checks `OtaSessionManager.hasActiveSession()` before honoring `ota_start`.
- If active session exists, `ota_start` is treated as a resume — glasses respond with current `ota_status` instead of creating a new session.
- Phone-side: `progress.tsx` tracks `sessionStarted` ref to avoid sending redundant `ota_start` on reconnect. On reconnect, always prefer `sendOtaQueryStatus()` if the session is already in flight.

### EC-3: Session Expiry Races with Step Completion

**Scenario:** Glasses are installing MTK firmware. The install takes 20 minutes (slow device, large firmware). The session's `created_at` timestamp was 25 minutes ago. A step completion or progress event triggers `OtaSessionManager` to read the session, which finds it "expired" (>30 min since creation) and clears it — killing the active OTA mid-flow.

**Mitigation (Section A — `last_activity_at_elapsed`):**

- Session expiry is based on `last_activity_at_elapsed` (monotonic `SystemClock.elapsedRealtime()`), not wall-clock creation time. The session is refreshed on every progress update, step transition, and phase change.
- The 30-minute expiry window means: "no activity for 30 minutes." As long as progress events flow (even slowly), the session stays alive.
- On step completion, `last_activity_at_elapsed` is explicitly updated before checking expiry.
- Using monotonic time also prevents NTP clock sync from artificially aging the session (see Section A — Timestamps).

### EC-4: BES Chip Hangs During UART Protocol

**Scenario:** Glasses send `SetStartInfo` to the BES chip. The chip ACKs, but hangs during the actual data transfer — no more UART responses arrive. The current code waits indefinitely in `dealOtaRecvCmd()`, holding a wakelock. The glasses never report FAILED to the phone, so the phone UI shows "Installing BES firmware..." forever.

**Mitigation (Section G — Total operation timeout):**

- Add `BES_TOTAL_TIMEOUT_MS = 300_000` (5 min). Record `startTime` when `startFirmwareUpdate()` is called.
- On each UART callback in `dealOtaRecvCmd()`, check elapsed time. If exceeded, call `cleanup()` and post `BesOtaProgressEvent.createFailed("BES timeout")`.
- `OtaHelper` receives the FAILED event and propagates it via `sendOtaStatus()` → phone shows failure with retry option.
- The per-operation wakelock (also increased to 5 min) ensures the total timeout can fire before the wakelock expires.

### EC-5: APK Install Restart Timing

**Scenario:** The glasses trigger APK install via `PackageInstaller`. The system kills the old ASG Client process and starts the new one. In rare cases, the new process's `OtaService.onCreate()` fires before the old process is fully dead. The new process reads the session from `SharedPreferences`, calls `checkAndResumeAfterApkUpdate()`, and begins MTK download — while the old process's pending I/O ops (e.g., incomplete `SharedPreferences` write) corrupt the session file.

**Mitigation (Section A — APK restart guard):**

- Before triggering APK install, write `restarting_since_elapsed = SystemClock.elapsedRealtime()` to the session.
- On app restart, if `restarting_since_elapsed` is set, skip expiry checks and wait 10 seconds from process start before proceeding. This gives the old process time to die and release file locks.
- After the wait, clear `restarting_since_elapsed` and continue with `checkAndResumeAfterApkUpdate()`.

## Edge Cases (Monitor — Lower Priority)

These are plausible but lower-frequency scenarios. They should be tracked but don't need to block the initial rearchitecture rollout.

### EC-L1: Battery Drops Below Critical During Update

**Scenario:** User starts OTA at 8% battery. APK installs fine. MTK download starts. Battery hits 3%. Glasses shut down mid-download.

**Recommendation:** Add a pre-flight battery check before `ota_start` (e.g., require >10%). Decide whether to also check before each step. A mid-step shutdown is already survivable (session persists, user retries after charging) — the question is whether to prevent it proactively.

### EC-L2: Insufficient Storage Mid-Update

**Scenario:** Glasses have 50MB free when APK downloads. APK install frees some space by replacing the old APK. MTK firmware file is 200MB and download fails partway through.

**Recommendation:** Add a pre-flight storage check. Sum the sizes of all artifacts to be downloaded (from the version manifest) and compare against available space. This requires adding file sizes to the version manifest.

### EC-L3: WiFi Network Changes Mid-Download

**Scenario:** Glasses are connected to WiFi A. User walks out of range. Glasses auto-connect to saved WiFi B (different subnet, potentially no internet). Download stalls or fails silently because the TCP connection to CDN drops without a clean error.

**Recommendation:** The HTTP connection timeout (15s connect, 30s read) already handles this — a stalled TCP connection will eventually fail. The retry logic (Section F) will re-attempt the download. No additional mitigation needed beyond existing timeout + retry, but worth monitoring in field telemetry.

## Open Questions

1. **Session expiry duration:** 30 minutes is proposed (based on `last_activity_at_elapsed`). Should it be longer for very slow connections (e.g., rural WiFi)?

2. **Step weight distribution:** Equal weight per step (33/33/33 for 3 steps) is simple but may not match perceived time. APK downloads are fast; MTK install is slow. Should weights be configurable per step type?

3. **BES `sr_adota` session context:** The phone needs to merge BES chip progress into the `ota_status` format. Should the glasses pre-send the session info before BES install starts (while UART is still available), or should the phone cache the last `ota_status` and overlay BES progress?

4. ~~**Retry semantics on phone:**~~ **RESOLVED.** "Retry" sends `ota_start`. Session locking (Section A) handles the rest: if the previous session failed, it gets cleared and a fresh session starts. If somehow still in-progress, the glasses resume instead of restarting. No separate `ota_resume` command needed.

5. **OTA simulation mode for testing:** Should the glasses support a `DEBUG_SIMULATE_OTA` flag that fakes the entire 3-step flow with delays and progress events, so the phone UI can be tested without real firmware?

6. **Pre-flight battery/storage checks (EC-L1, EC-L2):** Should these be hard gates (refuse to start OTA) or soft warnings (show advisory but allow user override)? What are the minimum thresholds?
