# Mentra Bluetooth SDK: iOS Native API Plan

## Goal

Make the Bluetooth SDK usable directly from bare iOS Swift apps, while MentraOS continues to use the same native implementation through a thin Expo adapter.

The customer-facing iOS API should not expose Expo, React Native, `DeviceManager`, `DeviceStore`, `Bridge`, or raw `"bluetooth"` / `"glasses"` store categories.

## Current iOS Lifecycle

The current iOS entrypoint is `BluetoothSdkModule.swift`, which imports `ExpoModulesCore`. On module creation it:

- Calls `Bridge.initialize { eventName, data in sendEvent(eventName, data) }`.
- Configures `DeviceStore.shared.store.configure` so `"glasses"` updates become `glasses_status` events and `"bluetooth"` updates become `bluetooth_status` events.
- Exposes Expo `AsyncFunction`s such as `update`, scan/connect helpers, `connectDefault`, `disconnect`, `displayText`, media commands, Wi-Fi commands, version commands, and microphone/STT commands.

The real hardware lifecycle lives under the Expo module adapter:

- `Bridge.swift` is a static event sink. It emits logs, status events, hardware events, mic frames, local transcriptions, and save-setting events back to the current callback.
- `DeviceManager.swift` is an `@MainActor` singleton. It owns the current glasses manager, current controller manager, display state, connection methods, Wi-Fi commands, media commands, local transcription, phone mic/audio handling, and cleanup.
- `DeviceStore.swift` is both state and command routing. `apply(category, key, value)` updates observable state and triggers hardware side effects for settings like brightness, dashboard position, gallery mode, button settings, preferred mic, stream flags, and default wearable.
- `SGCManager.swift` is the per-device abstraction implemented by G1, G2, Mentra Live, Mentra Nex, Mach1/Z100, simulated glasses, and controller classes.
- `MentraBluetoothSDK.podspec` now defaults to the bare native SDK. MentraOS sets `MENTRA_BLUETOOTH_SDK_INCLUDE_EXPO_ADAPTER=1` from its Podfile to include `ExpoModulesCore` and `BluetoothSdkModule.swift`.

This structure is a workable internal implementation, but the public API should be a typed Swift facade.

## Native API Shape

Create a public Swift-first facade:

```swift
@MainActor
public final class MentraBluetoothSDK {
    public weak var delegate: MentraBluetoothSDKDelegate?

    public init(configuration: MentraBluetoothSDKConfiguration = .default)

    public var glassesStatus: MentraGlassesStatus { get }
    public var bluetoothStatus: MentraBluetoothStatus { get }

    public func startScan(model: MentraDeviceModel)
    public func stopScan()
    public func connect(to device: MentraDiscoveredDevice)
    public func connect(model: MentraDeviceModel, name: String)
    public func connectDefault()
    public func disconnect()
    public func forget()

    public func displayText(_ request: MentraDisplayTextRequest) async throws
    public func clearDisplay() async throws
    public func showDashboard()

    public func setDashboardPosition(_ request: MentraDashboardPositionRequest) async throws
    public func setHeadUpAngle(_ angleDegrees: Int) async throws
    public func setScreenDisabled(_ disabled: Bool) async throws
    public func setGalleryModeEnabled(_ enabled: Bool) async throws -> MentraSettingsAckEvent
    public func setPhotoCaptureDefaults(_ defaults: MentraPhotoCaptureDefaults) async throws -> MentraSettingsAckEvent
    public func setButtonVideoRecordingSettings(_ settings: MentraButtonVideoRecordingSettings) async throws -> MentraSettingsAckEvent
    public func setButtonCameraLed(enabled: Bool) async throws -> MentraSettingsAckEvent
    public func setButtonMaxRecordingTime(minutes: Int) async throws -> MentraSettingsAckEvent
    public func setCameraFov(_ fov: MentraCameraFov) async throws -> MentraCameraFovResult

    public func setMicState(_ config: MentraMicConfiguration)
    public func setPreferredMic(_ preferredMic: MentraMicPreference)
    public func setOwnAppAudioPlaying(_ playing: Bool)

    public func requestWifiScan() async throws -> [MentraWifiScanResult]
    public func sendWifiCredentials(ssid: String, password: String) async throws -> MentraWifiStatusEvent
    public func forgetWifiNetwork(ssid: String) async throws -> MentraWifiStatusEvent
    public func setHotspotState(enabled: Bool) async throws -> MentraHotspotStatusEvent

    public func requestPhoto(_ request: MentraPhotoRequest) async throws -> MentraPhotoResponseEvent
    public func queryGalleryStatus() async throws -> MentraGalleryStatusEvent
    public func startStream(_ request: MentraStreamRequest)
    public func stopStream()
    public func startVideoRecording(_ request: MentraVideoRecordingRequest) async throws -> MentraVideoRecordingStatusEvent
    public func stopVideoRecording(requestId: String) async throws -> MentraVideoRecordingStatusEvent
    public func rgbLedControl(_ request: MentraRgbLedRequest) async throws -> MentraRgbLedControlResponseEvent

    public func requestVersionInfo() async throws -> MentraVersionInfoResult

    public func invalidate()
}
```

Photo, video, RGB LED, and settings methods throw when the correlated ASG event reports explicit failure; delegates still receive the raw success/error payloads.

`@MainActor` matches the current `DeviceManager` isolation and is idiomatic for a facade that interacts with CoreBluetooth state, audio state, and delegate callbacks. Long-running work should still happen inside the existing managers, not block the main actor.

## Capability Shape

The facade can be implemented as one class initially, but the customer-facing docs should not imply every feature is part of the minimum SDK contract.

Base v1 should include:

- Initialization, invalidation, permission/capability helpers, scan, connect, disconnect, forget, default-device handling, and status snapshots.
- Display primitives: display text, clear display, and show dashboard.
- Core hardware settings: brightness, auto brightness, dashboard height/depth, head-up angle, screen disable, gallery mode, button/camera settings, preferred mic, mic routing, and own-app-audio state.
- Common device events: status, discovered devices, button/touch/head-up, battery, Wi-Fi status, logs, and errors.

Advanced or capability-gated APIs should include:

- Camera/gallery commands and media transfer state.
- RTMP/video streaming and saved video recording.
- Version info commands. MentraOS-only OTA, shutdown, reboot, incident, and diagnostic commands stay behind the adapter boundary.
- Local STT, VAD/model management, and raw mic frame delivery.
- Controller pairing and RGB LED controls.

The SDK should expose capability state per connected device so customers can disable unsupported UI without relying on no-op behavior. Unsupported operations should either throw a typed `MentraBluetoothError` or emit a delegate failure, not silently appear to succeed.

## Delegate API

Use delegate callbacks for ongoing events:

```swift
@MainActor
public protocol MentraBluetoothSDKDelegate: AnyObject {
    func mentraBluetoothSDK(_ sdk: MentraBluetoothSDK, didUpdateGlassesStatus status: MentraGlassesStatusUpdate)
    func mentraBluetoothSDK(_ sdk: MentraBluetoothSDK, didUpdateBluetoothStatus status: MentraBluetoothStatusUpdate)
    func mentraBluetoothSDK(_ sdk: MentraBluetoothSDK, didDiscover device: MentraDiscoveredDevice)
    func mentraBluetoothSDK(_ sdk: MentraBluetoothSDK, didStopScan reason: MentraScanStopReason)
    func mentraBluetoothSDK(_ sdk: MentraBluetoothSDK, didReceive event: MentraBluetoothEvent)
    func mentraBluetoothSDK(_ sdk: MentraBluetoothSDK, didReceiveMicPcm frame: Data)
    func mentraBluetoothSDK(_ sdk: MentraBluetoothSDK, didReceiveMicLc3 frame: Data)
    func mentraBluetoothSDK(_ sdk: MentraBluetoothSDK, didChangeDefaultDevice device: MentraPairedDevice?)
    func mentraBluetoothSDK(_ sdk: MentraBluetoothSDK, didLog message: String)
    func mentraBluetoothSDK(_ sdk: MentraBluetoothSDK, didFail error: MentraBluetoothError)
}
```

For Swift Concurrency ergonomics, we can add an optional event stream:

```swift
public var events: AsyncStream<MentraBluetoothEvent> { get }
```

Do not make `AsyncStream` the only integration path in v1. Delegates are still the most familiar iOS library pattern and map cleanly to MentraOS's Expo event adapter.

## Public Models

Add typed public models before exposing the facade:

- `MentraDeviceModel`: `g1`, `g2`, `mentraLive`, `mentraNex`, `mach1`, `z100`, `frame`, `simulated`, `r1`.
- `MentraDiscoveredDevice`: `model`, `name`, optional `identifier`, optional `rssi`.
- `MentraGlassesStatus`: current snapshot of connected, fully booted, battery, charging, model, firmware, serial, Wi-Fi, hotspot, head-up, controller, and signal state.
- `MentraBluetoothStatus`: current snapshot of searching, mic, current mic, search results, Wi-Fi scan results, permission availability, and audio availability.
- `MentraDisplayTextRequest`, `MentraDisplayEventRequest`, `MentraDashboardPositionRequest`, `MentraDashboardMenuItem`, `MentraPhotoRequest`, `MentraStreamRequest`, `MentraVideoRecordingRequest`, `MentraMicConfiguration`, `MentraBluetoothError`.
- Settings models/enums for values currently routed through `DeviceStore.apply()`: `MentraPhotoCaptureDefaults`, `MentraPhotoSize`, `MentraButtonVideoRecordingSettings`, `MentraCameraFov`, and `MentraMicPreference`.
- Typed value enums should reflect device-specific capability boundaries rather than raw string payloads: `MentraPhotoSize` uses the current `low` / `medium` / `high` / `max` tiers, `MentraPhotoCompression` is `none` / `medium` / `heavy`; `MentraRgbLedAction` and `MentraRgbLedColor` represent the Mentra Live/K900 RGB ring surface; stream request fields are typed while the actual streaming protocol is selected from the URL prefix.

Prefer Swift structs and enums with clear defaults. Objective-C compatibility is not a v1 requirement unless a customer asks for it.

## Store Sync Boundary

The current MentraOS integration has two stores:

- MentraOS TypeScript uses Zustand stores for app settings, Bluetooth status, and glasses status.
- Native iOS uses `DeviceStore` / `ObservableStore` for hardware state and setting side effects.

This two-store setup can remain internally, but it should not become the public iOS SDK paradigm. External iOS customers should not call `update("bluetooth", values)`, listen for `save_setting`, or know which raw keys cause hardware side effects.

The target boundary is:

- Public SDK callers use typed methods such as `setPreferredMic`, `startScan`, `connect`, `displayText`, and `setMicState`.
- Public SDK callers receive typed delegate callbacks such as `didUpdateGlassesStatus`, `didUpdateBluetoothStatus`, `didDiscover`, and `didReceive`.
- All hardware side effects currently hidden inside `DeviceStore.apply()` should have a typed public or adapter-only entrypoint before MentraOS removes blob sync.
- `DeviceStore` remains an implementation detail behind `MentraBluetoothSDK`.
- SDK-owned persistence should use a typed storage/config abstraction or default UserDefaults storage. It should not ask external apps to persist arbitrary MentraOS setting keys.
- `didChangeDefaultDevice` can notify apps that the remembered device changed, but the SDK should own the default storage path unless the app provides a custom storage implementation.

## Permissions And Host Lifecycle

The host app should own permission copy and prompts. The SDK documentation should clearly require:

- `NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription`.
- `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` when phone mic, local transcription, or audio streaming is used.
- Any local network, camera roll, or background mode notes that are required by specific device features.

The SDK can expose helpers for capability checks, but it should not surprise customers by prompting permissions during initialization.

```swift
public enum MentraSDKFeature {
    case scanning
    case phoneMicrophone
    case localTranscription
    case mediaStreaming
}

public struct MentraPermissionStatus {
    public let bluetooth: MentraPermissionState
    public let microphone: MentraPermissionState
}
```

`invalidate()` should stop scans, disconnect or settle active device managers where appropriate, stop phone mic capture, shut down local transcription resources, remove event sinks, and release delegate references. `deinit` should call the same cleanup path defensively.

## MentraOS Adapter

MentraOS should keep its TypeScript API stable. `BluetoothSdkModule.swift` becomes an adapter that:

- Owns one `MentraBluetoothSDK` instance.
- Implements `MentraBluetoothSDKDelegate`.
- Maps typed delegate callbacks back to existing Expo event names such as `glasses_status`, `bluetooth_status`, `button_press`, `mic_pcm`, and `save_setting`.
- Translates existing stringly typed `update("core" | "bluetooth", values)` calls into typed facade calls or internal settings updates while MentraOS migrates.
- Lets `mobile/src/services/bluetooth/MentraBluetoothSdkAdapter.ts` watch Zustand settings and call typed SDK methods directly over time, with `BluetoothSettingsSync.ts` and `BluetoothEventBridge.ts` extracted as helpers if the adapter grows.
- Keeps legacy `"core"` category normalization inside the adapter/store compatibility layer, not in the public native API.
- Keeps MentraOS cloud formatting in TypeScript services such as `SocketComms.ts`, `RestComms.ts`, and `DisplayProcessor.ts`; iOS should emit typed hardware events, not MentraOS websocket or REST payloads.

This lets MentraOS keep using the SDK while external customers use the native iOS facade.

## Packaging Plan

The bare iOS SDK should be available through CocoaPods first:

- `MentraBluetoothSDK`: bare native pod with no `ExpoModulesCore` dependency.
- `MentraBluetoothSDKExpoAdapter` or the existing Expo module target: adapter layer that depends on `MentraBluetoothSDK` and `ExpoModulesCore`.

The bare podspec must not use a broad source glob that accidentally includes Expo adapter files. Source ownership should be explicit:

- Bare pod: `Source/**`, required `Packages/**` native sources, resources, vendored frameworks, and privacy manifest.
- Expo adapter pod/subspec/module: `BluetoothSdkModule.swift`, Expo config, and any adapter-only source files.

Swift Package Manager support should be evaluated after CocoaPods is working because the current implementation includes vendored frameworks, ONNX runtime, UltraliteSDK, resources, C/C++ headers, and local model files.

The public podspec must include the native dependencies and privacy manifest, but not require the host app to be an Expo or React Native project.

Heavy dependencies should be audited before release. Local STT, ONNX/VAD, UltraliteSDK, and media streaming may remain in the initial pod if that is fastest, but the plan should keep a path open for subspecs or optional artifacts if binary size or dependency conflicts become a customer problem.

Current implementation status:

- The podspec defaults to a bare CocoaPods artifact with `SWCompression`, `SwiftProtobuf`, `onnxruntime-objc`, and `UltraliteSDK`, and no `ExpoModulesCore`.
- The bare source list is explicit: `Source/**`, `Packages/CoreObjC/**`, Sherpa ONNX Swift/header files, VAD Swift files, and the libbz2 shim header. It does not use a broad catch-all that would accidentally compile the Expo adapter.
- `BluetoothSdkModule.swift` and `ExpoModulesCore` are included only when `MENTRA_BLUETOOTH_SDK_INCLUDE_EXPO_ADAPTER=1` is set, which MentraOS does from `mobile/ios/Podfile`.
- The MentraOS Expo module now owns a `MentraBluetoothSDK` instance and maps delegate callbacks back to the existing Expo event names. Adapter-only commands such as controller pairing, debug helpers, media volume, RGB LED control, and STT model utilities still call the current internals until the public facade grows those APIs.
- `pod ipc spec` verifies both podspec modes, the Partner Kit iOS example runs `pod install` without Expo, and the example app builds for iOS Simulator against the public Swift facade.
- MentraOS `pod install` and the `MentraBluetoothSDK` iOS scheme build with the Expo adapter enabled.

## Extraction Plan

1. Add an internal event sink behind the current `Bridge` behavior so events can fan out to the Swift facade and the Expo adapter without changing emitted event names.
2. Keep `DeviceManager`, `DeviceStore`, `ObservableStore`, and `SGCManager` internal implementation details while making lifecycle ownership explicit through the facade.
3. Add the public model files, settings models, delegate protocol, configuration type, and error enum without changing behavior.
4. Add `MentraBluetoothSDK` facade that delegates to the existing `DeviceManager`, `DeviceStore`, and SGC internals.
5. Keep `updateBluetoothSettings`, `"core"` normalization, and `save_setting` as MentraOS compatibility plumbing only.
6. Add `mobile/src/services/bluetooth/MentraBluetoothSdkAdapter.ts` and translate Zustand changes into typed SDK calls setting group by setting group.
7. Move `BluetoothSdkModule.swift` into the adapter layer so the bare SDK pod can remove `ExpoModulesCore`.
8. Update `MentraBluetoothSDK.podspec` so a clean iOS app can run `pod install` without Expo and without compiling Expo adapter files.
9. Add a bare iOS sample app in `Mentra-Bluetooth-SDK-Partner-Kit` that initializes the SDK, scans, connects, displays text, clears display, applies a core setting, and logs status events.
10. Keep the existing mobile regression tests passing with little or no TypeScript test changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A new bare iOS app can depend on the pod without Expo or React Native.
- Swift callers can initialize the SDK, set a delegate, scan, connect, display text, and disconnect.
- Swift callers can apply the core hardware settings currently handled by `DeviceStore.apply()` without using raw setting keys.
- MentraOS still builds and uses the same implementation through `BluetoothSdkModule.swift`.
- Public docs never tell customers to call `DeviceManager`, `DeviceStore`, `Bridge`, `update("bluetooth", ...)`, or handle `save_setting`.
- The iOS sample app in `Mentra-Bluetooth-SDK-Partner-Kit` builds from a clean checkout and exercises the public facade.
- The iOS sample app covers SDK initialization, permission declarations, scan, discovery delegate, connect discovered/default, status/log/error delegates, display text, brightness/dashboard settings, clear display, disconnect, and `invalidate()`.
- `pod install` verifies the bare pod source list excludes Expo adapter files and has no `ExpoModulesCore` dependency.
- Cleanup is explicit for scans, active connections, phone mic, local transcription, and event delivery.

## Open Questions

- Whether the adapter should be a separate pod, a CocoaPods subspec, or only an internal Expo module target.
- Whether media, streaming, and local transcription should ship in the base SDK facade or be grouped behind capability protocols.
- Whether the first version needs Objective-C compatibility.
- Whether Swift Package Manager is worth supporting before the dependency graph is simplified.
