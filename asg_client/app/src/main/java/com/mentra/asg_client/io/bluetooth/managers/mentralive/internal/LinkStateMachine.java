/**
 * Single owner of the ASG-to-BES UART transport link state.
 *
 * <p>Historically "connected" was five separate implicit facts spread across volatile booleans in
 * {@code K900BluetoothManager} ({@code isSerialOpen}, the {@code lastSrSyvrTime} liveness aspect,
 * and the negotiated {@code besWireCaps*} flags), each with its own ad-hoc reset sites. Listeners
 * that registered after the only edge of one of those facts never learned about it, which is the
 * bug class this class exists to remove. All transport-side facts now live here, transitions are
 * driven from the exact call sites that used to flip the booleans, and {@link #addListener}
 * synchronously replays the current state so late subscribers can never miss an edge.
 *
 * <p>The link is modeled as a three-step ladder:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   SERIAL_CLOSED  --serialReady()-->  SERIAL_OPEN  --srSyvrParsed()-->  LINK_PROVEN
 * </pre>
 *
 * with two demotions: {@link #streamDiscontinuity()} (a reopen/baud switch invalidated the byte
 * stream, so the link is no longer proven at the current baud) drops back to {@code SERIAL_OPEN},
 * and {@link #serialClosed()} resets everything.
 *
 * <p>A failed coordinator-owned reopen uses {@link #serialUnavailable()}: the physical state is
 * {@code SERIAL_CLOSED}, but negotiated caps and phone presence survive because recovery still
 * belongs to the same BES and phone sessions. A terminal {@link #serialClosed()} remains the only
 * full reset.
 *
 * <p>Orthogonal to the ladder, {@link PhonePresence} tracks whether the BES currently holds a phone
 * BLE connection (see the enum Javadoc for the firmware contract and the tri-state degradation rule
 * for old firmware).
 *
 * <p>Caps have two views on purpose:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #getProvenCaps()} (also the listener payload) is non-null only in {@code
 *       LINK_PROVEN}: it is the snapshot a consumer may trust because an sr_syvr proved the link at
 *       the current baud.
 *   <li>{@link #getNegotiatedCaps()} is the sticky negotiation result, cleared only by {@link
 *       #serialClosed()}. This mirrors the legacy reset rules exactly: a mid-session baud reopen
 *       never cleared {@code besWireCaps*}, and outbound capability decisions (binary relay, file
 *       payload v2, push window) must not silently downgrade for a whole phone session just because
 *       a reopen window was in flight. The legacy delegating getters read this view.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Thread safety: transitions arrive from the serial RX thread, the baud-switch executor, and
 * binder threads. All state mutation and listener notification happen under the internal monitor,
 * and deliveries go through a FIFO dispatch queue (reentrant transitions from inside a callback are
 * queued behind the pass in flight), so every listener observes transitions in a single global
 * order — always ending on the machine's final state — and replay-on-subscribe cannot interleave
 * with a concurrent transition. Listeners must therefore be fast and must not block on locks that
 * transition callers might hold.
