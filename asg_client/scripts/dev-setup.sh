# dev-setup.sh - Install your custom asg_client on Mentra Live
#
# This script builds your fork of asg_client, disables the stock app,
# and installs your version as the default launcher.
#
# How it works:
#   - Stock asg_client is a system app signed with Mentra's key
#   - Your build uses package name com.mentra.asg_client.thirdparty
#   - Stock app is disabled (not deleted) so your app becomes the launcher
#   - To restore stock: ./scripts/restore-stock.sh
#
# Usage:
#   1. Connect to your Mentra Live via ADB (Infinity Cable)
#   2. Run: ./scripts/dev-setup.sh
#
