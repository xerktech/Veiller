# Mentra asg_client

A MentraOS glasses client that runs on Android-based smart glasses such as Mentra Live.

### Compatible Devices

- Mentra Live

### Hardware Architecture (Mentra Live)

Mentra Live has two SOCs: an **MTK** chip running Android (where `asg_client` runs) and a **BES** chip running an RTOS. The BES owns the phone link and most peripherals; the MTK is asleep by default and is woken on demand for camera, Wi-Fi, and heavier compute. The two chips talk over **UART** (control) and **I2S** (audio).

    BES_CORE <-- UART --> MTK_CORE
    BES_CORE <-- I2S --> MTK_CORE

Implications for development:

- The phone never talks to the MTK directly. All phone ↔ glasses traffic goes through BES, then over UART/I2S to the MTK when needed.
- Anything battery-cheap (button presses, touch input, status LED, the always-on audio path) lives on BES.
- Anything heavy (camera capture, RTMP streaming, Wi-Fi, on-device processing) requires waking the MTK.

### Environment Setup

1. Create a `.env` file by copying the provided example:

   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. By default, the example contains production settings:

   ```
   MENTRAOS_HOST=api.mentra.glass
   MENTRAOS_PORT=443
   MENTRAOS_SECURE=true
   ```

3. Initialize the RTMP streaming library submodule (skip if you cloned with
   `--recurse-submodules`); from this `asg_client/` directory:
   ```
   git submodule update --init StreamPackLite
   ```

### Development on Mentra Live

Mentra Live ships with `com.mentra.asg_client` as a **system app** signed with Mentra's release key. To run your own build, `./scripts/dev-setup.sh` installs a fork alongside it under a separate package (`com.mentra.asg_client.thirdparty`), disables the stock app, and makes your build the default launcher; `./scripts/restore-stock.sh` reverses this.

### Phone App Compatibility

The MentraOS phone app must stay backward-compatible with older `asg_client` builds already in the field. When changing phone-to-glasses or glasses-to-phone protocol behavior, new phone app code should continue to accept old `asg_client` message shapes and unchunked responses.

The opposite direction is not a required compatibility target: a new `asg_client` build does not need to support older MentraOS phone apps. On startup, the phone app calls the cloud `GET /api/client/min-version` endpoint and compares its local app version with the cloud `required` and `recommended` versions. If the local app is below `required`, startup is blocked by the update flow instead of continuing into pairing or BLE use. The cloud values are defined in `cloud/packages/cloud/src/version.ts` and served by `cloud/packages/cloud/src/api/hono/client/min-version.api.ts`; the mobile startup check is in `mobile/src/app/index.tsx`.

### Connecting via ADB

#### USB ADB

Snap the Infinity Cable onto the contacts on the right temple, plug the other end into your computer, then run `adb devices` to confirm. USB debugging ships enabled and authorized from the factory.

#### WiFi ADB

Find the glasses' Local IP Address in the MentraOS app (Glasses screen), then:

```bash
adb connect <GLASSES_IP>:5555
adb devices
```

### Installing Your Custom Build of asg_client

```bash
./scripts/dev-setup.sh
```

This script will:

1. Build your debug APK
2. Install it as `com.mentra.asg_client.thirdparty`, disable the stock app, and set your build as the default launcher
3. Grant all required permissions

**Warning:** Your fork will not receive OTA updates from Mentra.

### Restoring Stock Firmware

```bash
./scripts/restore-stock.sh
```

This removes your custom build and restores the factory app.

### Build Notes

Must use Java SDK 17. To set this, in Android Studio, go to Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle, go to Gradle JDK and select version 17
