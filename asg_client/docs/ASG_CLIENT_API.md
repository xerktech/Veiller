# ASG Client Command API

`asg_client` exposes a JSON command API that controls hardware and system features on Mentra Live smart glasses. Every command is a JSON object with a `"type"` field that selects a handler.

This API is reached over two transports:

1. **BLE (primary)** — the Mentra phone app sends commands over BLE.
2. **Intent broadcast (debug/testing)** — the same commands can be sent via Android broadcast intents from a debug APK or `adb shell am broadcast`.

Both paths funnel into `CommandProcessor.processJsonCommand(JSONObject)`, so all command behavior is identical regardless of transport. See [Debug interface](#debug-interface-intent-broadcast) for the intent path.

> This document is the source-of-truth wire reference. Behavioral notes (lifecycle, reconnect, timeouts) live in the corresponding [feature docs](features/).

## Common fields

Every command may include:

| Field  | Type   | Required | Description                                                         |
| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type` | string | yes      | Command identifier (rows below)                                     |
| `mId`  | long   | no       | Message ID. If present, glasses immediately reply with a `msg_ack`. |

### `msg_ack` (auto-response when `mId` is set)

```json
{"type": "msg_ack", "mId": 1234567890, "timestamp": 1708963201234}
```

### Photo

#### `take_photo`

Capture a still photo. The handler routes through `transferMethod` to one of three pipelines: direct upload to a webhook, BLE transfer to the phone, or auto (direct with BLE fallback).

```json
{
  "type": "take_photo",
  "requestId": "photo_001",
  "packageName": "com.example.app",
  "webhookUrl": "https://api.example.com/upload",
  "authToken": "Bearer abc123",
  "transferMethod": "auto",
  "bleImgId": "img_001",
  "save": false,
  "size": "medium",
  "mode": "text",
  "compress": "none",
  "flash": true,
  "sound": true
}
```

| Field            | Type    | Default             | Description                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `requestId`      | string  | —                   | Required; correlates request with response                  |
| `packageName`    | string  | resolved by handler | Originating app package                                     |
| `webhookUrl`     | string  | ""                  | HTTPS endpoint for `direct` / `auto` upload                 |
| `authToken`      | string  | ""                  | Bearer token for the webhook                                |
| `transferMethod` | string  | `"direct"`          | One of `direct`, `ble`, `auto`. `auto` requires `bleImgId`. |
| `bleImgId`       | string  | ""                  | Required for `ble` and `auto` transfer methods              |
| `save`           | boolean | `false`             | Also save the photo to local gallery                        |
| `size`               | string  | `"medium"`          | `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `max` (legacy `small`→`low`, `large`→`high`, `full`→`max`) |
| `mode`               | string  | `"photo"`           | `photo` for normal capture, or `text` for ASG text-sensor constants + text-aware BLE processing |

**Text mode behavior**

- Captures at ASG-owned sensor dimensions (`TEXT_MODE_SENSOR_CAPTURE_*`, currently 3840×2160 — Mentra Live's max 16:9 still) via an internal resolution tier — not the public `max` quality tier. Requested `size` is ignored for sensor resolution.
- Runs text-region detection and crops to the detected ROI before BLE transfer.
- Uses a dedicated 2880 px long-edge cap after a successful text crop; the configured BLE codec and quality apply afterward (currently JPEG quality 80).
- If detection finds no usable text region or fails, the pipeline preserves the full frame and retains the smaller 1920 px fallback cap.
- Best results on documents, signs, and windshield VIN stickers; plain scenes may look similar to `photo` when the full-frame fallback is used.
| `compress`           | string  | `"none"`            | Compression preset passed to capture pipeline               |
| `flash`              | boolean | `true`              | Fire the privacy LED during capture                         |
| `sound`              | boolean | `true`              | Play shutter sound                                          |
| `exposureTimeNs`     | number  | absent              | Optional one-shot manual sensor exposure time in ns         |
| `iso`                | number  | absent              | Optional one-shot manual sensor ISO; ignored without manual exposure |
| `aeExposureDivisor`  | number  | absent              | After AE convergence, divide metered exposure by this factor (scan tuning) |
| `isoCap`             | number  | absent              | Cap ISO after AE metering (scan tuning)                     |
| `noiseReduction`     | boolean | absent              | Parsed; warn-only if unsupported (`not_implemented` in metadata) |
| `edgeEnhancement`    | boolean | absent              | `false` disables edge enhancement on still capture          |
| `zsl`                | boolean | absent              | ZSL preview/capture buffering. Enabled by default; pass `false` to disable. Manual and scan exposure force it off on the still request because buffered capture conflicts with fixed sensor controls. |
| `mfnr`               | boolean | absent              | Vendor multi-frame noise reduction on still capture. Enabled by default; pass `false` for the single-frame pipeline. Manual and scan exposure force it off because the vendor pipeline can override fixed sensor controls. MFNR arms ZSL buffering in preview even when `zsl` is false. |
| `ispDigitalGain`     | number  | absent              | Parsed; warn-only if unsupported                            |
| `ispAnalogGain`      | string  | absent              | Parsed; warn-only if unsupported                            |

In `text` mode, Mentra Live captures the source JPEG using ASG text-mode sensor constants
(`TEXT_MODE_SENSOR_CAPTURE_WIDTH` × `TEXT_MODE_SENSOR_CAPTURE_HEIGHT`, currently 3840×2160),
selecting an exact Camera2 JPEG size match when available or the closest supported size otherwise.
Text mode does not inject an AE exposure divisor; pass `aeExposureDivisor` explicitly when you
want scan-style shorter shutter. Text-region detection and crop run on both WiFi upload and BLE
transfer. On BLE, the crop happens before downscale. A successful text crop uses a 2880 px
long-edge cap; a full-frame fallback uses a 1920 px cap. Requested {@code size} does not change
either text-mode cap.

All BLE photo payloads — text mode and ordinary size-tier photos alike — encode with the single
codec configured in `AsgConstants.BLE_PHOTO_CODEC`. There is no per-mode split: flipping this one
constant between `AVIF` (default; quality set per size tier) and `JPEG_FAST` (baseline JPEG at
`BLE_PHOTO_JPEG_FAST_QUALITY`, encodes in tens of milliseconds on the MT8766 instead of the ~4-5 s
software AVIF encode) changes both paths at once.

**Constraints (all enforced in `PhotoCommandHandler`):**

- Battery ≥ `BatteryConstants.MIN_BATTERY_LEVEL` (currently 10%)
- No video recording in progress
- No BLE transfer in progress
- No other photo capture in progress

**Responses:** the handler can produce three different response types depending on the path taken.

`photo_response` — terminal success or failure for the full photo action. Camera-busy, low-battery, storage, FOV-restart, capture, direct-upload, and Bluetooth-fallback failures emit `state: "error"`. A success response means capture completed and the photo reached the configured upload target, either directly from the glasses or through the phone fallback relay. Capture, upload, and Bluetooth fallback progress continue through `photo_status` until this terminal response:

```json
{
  "type": "photo_response",
  "requestId": "photo_001",
  "state": "success",
  "success": true,
  "uploadUrl": "https://api.example.com/mentra/photo",
  "photoUrl": "https://cdn.example.com/photos/photo_001.jpg",
  "contentType": "image/jpeg",
  "fileSizeBytes": 58489
}
```

`ble_photo_ready` — BLE transfer started successfully:

```json
{"type": "ble_photo_ready", "bleImgId": "img_001", "requestId": "photo_001"}
```

`photo_status` — capture and transfer progress:

```json
{
  "type": "photo_status",
  "requestId": "photo_001",
  "status": "capturing",
  "timestamp": 1708963201234,
  "requestedCaptureConfig": {
    "manual": false,
    "aeMode": 1,
    "aeTargetFpsRange": {"min": 5, "max": 30}
  },
  "meteredPreview": {
    "exposureTimeNs": 8333333,
    "iso": 200,
    "totalLightProxy": 1666.6666
  }
}
```

Status metadata is stage-specific:

| Status | Optional fields | Description |
| ------ | --------------- | ----------- |
| `configuring` | `resolvedConfig` | Effective JPEG dimensions, quality, requested size, source (`sdk` or `button`), transfer method, compression, and manual exposure fields when present |
| `capturing` | `requestedCaptureConfig`, `meteredPreview` | Camera2 still request about to be submitted, plus the latest AE preview estimate before capture |
| `captured` | `captureMetadata` | HAL-applied still capture result, including actual exposure time, ISO, frame duration, AE state/name, sensor timestamp, and related camera modes when available |
| `uploading`, `compressing`, `ble_fallback_compression`, `ready_for_transfer`, `transferring` | none | Transport progress only; capture metadata is not repeated here. `ble_fallback_compression` means Wi-Fi/webhook upload failed and the photo is being compressed for Bluetooth fallback |
| `failed` | `errorCode`, `errorMessage` | Capture or transfer failure details |

`captureMetadata` on `captured` is the right place to read the actual still capture values:

```json
{
  "type": "photo_status",
  "requestId": "photo_001",
  "status": "captured",
  "timestamp": 1708963202345,
  "captureMetadata": {
    "manual": false,
    "exposureTimeNs": 8333333,
    "iso": 200,
    "frameDurationNs": 33333333,
    "aeState": 2,
    "aeStateName": "CONVERGED"
  }
}
```

Action-button photos emitted by the glasses use the same `photo_status` shape while the phone SDK is connected. These local captures use a `local_<timestamp>` request ID and report `resolvedConfig.source: "button"` with `resolvedConfig.transferMethod: "local"`.

`ble_photo_error` / `photo_error_response` — legacy BLE/photo failure notifications. The current request/response contract uses `photo_response` with `state: "error"` as the terminal failure for SDK callers; these legacy notifications may still appear in older diagnostic flows and should be treated as error progress, not as a second success/error contract:

```json
{
  "type": "photo_error_response",
  "requestId": "photo_001",
  "error_code": "BATTERY_LOW",
  "error_message": "Battery level too low (8%) - minimum 10% required"
}
```

Error codes the handler can emit: `BATTERY_LOW`, `VIDEO_RECORDING_ACTIVE`, `BLE_TRANSFER_BUSY`, `CAMERA_BUSY`, `INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE`, `UPLOAD_SYSTEM_BUSY`, `CAPTURE_TIMEOUT`, `CAMERA_CAPTURE_FAILED`, `BLE_TRANSFER_BUSY`, `BLE_TRANSFER_FAILED`, `BLE_TRANSFER_FAILED_TO_START`.

Photo captures embed IMU payload directly into JPEG EXIF metadata when available.

### Video recording

Wire response type for all video commands: `video_recording_status`.

#### `start_video_recording`

```json
{
  "type": "start_video_recording",
  "requestId": "video_001",
  "settings": {"width": 1280, "height": 720, "fps": 30},
  "save": false,
  "flash": true,
  "sound": true
}
```

| Field             | Type    | Default        | Description                  |
| ----------------- | ------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `requestId`       | string  | `"video_<ts>"` | Used for stop validation     |
| `settings.width`  | int     | sensor default | Optional capture width       |
| `settings.height` | int     | sensor default | Optional capture height      |
| `settings.fps`    | int     | 30             | Frames per second            |
| `save`            | boolean | `false`        | Save to local gallery        |
| `flash`           | boolean | `true`         | Privacy LED during recording |
| `sound`           | boolean | `true`         | Start/stop tones             |

Same battery constraint as photo. `recording_started` is the successful start status. `already_recording`, `battery_low`, `service_unavailable`, `missing_request_id`, and `error` are emitted with `success: false`.

```json
{"type": "video_recording_status", "success": true, "status": "recording_started", "timestamp": 1708963201234}
```

#### `stop_video_recording`

```json
{"type": "stop_video_recording", "requestId": "video_001"}
```

If `requestId` is provided, the capture service validates it matches the active recording. Status values: `recording_stopped`, `not_recording`, `service_unavailable`, `error`.

#### `get_video_recording_status`

```json
{"type": "get_video_recording_status"}
```

Response while recording:

```json
{
  "type": "video_recording_status",
  "success": true,
  "data": {"recording": true, "duration_ms": 15000, "duration_formatted": "00:15"}
}
```

### Streaming (RTMP / SRT / WHIP)

The handler is `StreamCommandHandler` (file: `service/core/handlers/StreamCommandHandler.java`). The same four commands handle all three protocols — the protocol is detected from the URL prefix (`rtmp://` / `rtmps://`, `srt://`, `http(s)://` for WHIP).

See [features/rtmp-streaming.md](features/rtmp-streaming.md) for stream lifecycle, reconnect behavior, and the keep-alive/timeout contract.

#### `start_stream`

```json
{
  "type": "start_stream",
  "streamUrl": "rtmp://streaming.example.com/live/stream",
  "streamId": "stream_123",
  "video": {"width": 1280, "height": 720, "fps": 30, "bitrate": 2500},
  "audio": {"sample_rate": 48000, "bitrate": 128},
  "flash": true,
  "sound": true
}
```

| Field       | Type    | Default  | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | ------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `streamUrl` | string  | —        | Required. Legacy fallbacks: `rtmpUrl`, `srtUrl`, `whipUrl` (any one is accepted).                                             |
| `streamId`  | string  | ""       | Used to validate keep-alives and ACKs                                                                                         |
| `video`     | object  | defaults | `width`, `height`, `fps`, `bitrate`. Compact alias: `v`. Parsed by `RtmpStreamConfig.fromJson` / `WhipStreamConfig.fromJson`. |
| `audio`     | object  | defaults | `sample_rate`, `bitrate`. Compact alias: `a`.                                                                                 |
| `flash`     | boolean | `true`   | Privacy LED during stream                                                                                                     |
| `sound`     | boolean | `true`   | Start/stop tones                                                                                                              |

**Constraints:** battery ≥ 10%, WiFi connected. WHIP streams whose requested resolution exceeds the camera's supported output are rejected (`WhipCameraFormatSelector`).

**Response wire type:** `stream_status` (new universal type from `MediaManager.sendStreamStatusResponse`). Legacy `rtmp_stream_status` is still produced by `ResponseBuilder` in some paths.

```json
{"type": "stream_status", "kind": "lifecycle", "status": "streaming", "timestamp": 1708963201234}
```

While a stream is active, supported firmware also emits this status periodically with live encoder and device telemetry:

```json
{"type": "stream_status", "status": "streaming", "streamId": "stream-123", "stats": {"bitrate": 2450000, "fps": 29.8, "droppedFrames": 3, "duration": 42, "temperatureC": 54.6}}
```

`bitrate` is in bits per second, `duration` is in seconds, and `temperatureC` is omitted when the CPU thermal sensor is unavailable.

#### `stop_stream`

```json
{"type": "stop_stream"}
```

Stops whichever stream service is active. Status: `stopping`; if no stream is active, `status` is `error` with `errorDetails: "not_streaming"`.

#### `get_stream_status`

```json
{"type": "get_stream_status"}
```

Response includes a `streaming` boolean and a `reconnecting` flag. When reconnecting, RTMP/SRT include an `attempt` counter:

```json
{"type": "stream_status", "kind": "snapshot", "status": "streaming", "streaming": true, "reconnecting": false, "timestamp": 1708963201234}
```

#### `keep_stream_alive`

Heartbeat to extend the stream timeout. Both `streamId` and `ackId` are required; missing either is silently ignored.

```json
{"type": "keep_stream_alive", "streamId": "stream_123", "ackId": "ack_456"}
```

ACK response:

```json
{"type": "keep_alive_ack", "streamId": "stream_123", "ackId": "ack_456", "timestamp": 1708963201234}
```

---

### WiFi & hotspot

#### `set_wifi_credentials`

```json
{"type": "set_wifi_credentials", "ssid": "MyNetwork", "password": "password123"}
```

Initiates connection. After ~3s the handler polls connection status up to 4 times and sends a `wifi_status` event when settled.

#### `request_wifi_status`

```json
{"type": "request_wifi_status"}
```

Response:

```json
{"type": "wifi_status", "connected": true}
```

#### `request_wifi_scan`

```json
{"type": "request_wifi_scan"}
```

Streams results back over BLE as they're discovered. Intermediate payloads use `scan_complete: false`; a final payload with `scan_complete: true` is sent when the scan finishes, including an empty list when no networks are found.

```json
{
  "type": "wifi_scan_result",
  "scan_complete": false,
  "networks_neo": [{"ssid": "MyNetwork", "signal_strength": -45, "security": "WPA2"}]
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "wifi_scan_result",
  "scan_complete": true,
  "networks_neo": []
}
```

#### `set_hotspot_state`

```json
{"type": "set_hotspot_state", "enabled": true}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "type": "hotspot_status_update",
  "hotspot_enabled": true,
  "hotspot_ssid": "MentraLive_XXXX",
  "hotspot_password": "xxxxxxxx",
  "hotspot_gateway_ip": "192.168.43.1"
}
```

#### `set_system_time`

Sets the glasses system clock from the phone. Sent only when the phone detects clock skew during gallery sync or OTA version checks (not on every BLE connect).

```json
{"type": "set_system_time", "timestamp_ms": 1710000000000}
```

No response is required for V1 (fire-and-forget).

#### `disconnect_wifi`

```json
{"type": "disconnect_wifi"}
```

#### `forget_wifi`

```json
{"type": "forget_wifi", "ssid": "OldNetwork"}
```

`ssid` is required; empty SSID returns `false` without action.

---

### Battery

#### `request_battery_state`

```json
{"type": "request_battery_state"}
```

#### `battery_status`

Update battery state on the glasses (used by the phone to push estimated state, e.g. while charging is detected externally):

```json
{"type": "battery_status", "level": 85, "charging": false, "timestamp": 1708963201234}
```

The glasses also emit `battery_status` outbound:

```json
{"type": "battery_status", "percent": 85, "charging": false}
```

---

### Version / system info

#### `request_version` / `cs_syvr`

```json
{"type": "request_version"}
```

Returns version information in chunks to fit the BLE MTU:

- `version_info_1`: `app_version`, `build_number`, `device_model`, `android_version`, `system_time_ms`, `sid`
- `version_info_3`: `bes_fw_version`, `mtk_fw_version`, `bt_mac_address`, `serial_number`

`serial_number` is the Android firmware product serial from `ro.serialno`; the
generic `0123456789ABCDEF` Android/ADB placeholder is omitted.
`bt_mac_address` comes from BES and may arrive in a follow-up `version_info_3`
after BES responds to the MAC-address request.

---

### IMU / sensors

Handler: `ImuCommandHandler`. Power-optimized; streaming auto-times out.

#### `imu_single`

```json
{"type": "imu_single"}
```

Response (sample):

```json
{
  "type": "imu_response",
  "timestamp": 1708963201234,
  "accelerometer": {"x": 0.1, "y": 0.2, "z": 9.8},
  "gyroscope": {"x": 0.01, "y": 0.02, "z": 0.03}
}
```

#### `imu_stream_start`

```json
{"type": "imu_stream_start", "rate_hz": 50, "batch_ms": 100}
```

| Field      | Type | Default | Range            |

#### `imu_stream_stop`

```json
{"type": "imu_stream_stop"}
```

#### `imu_subscribe_gesture` _(under construction)_

> **Under construction.** The handler accepts these commands but the gesture detection itself is not finished — don't rely on this in production code yet.

```json
{"type": "imu_subscribe_gesture", "gestures": ["head_up", "head_down", "nod_yes", "shake_no"]}
```

Acknowledgement:

```json
{"type": "imu_gesture_subscribed", "gestures": ["head_up", "head_down"]}
```

When a subscribed gesture fires:

```json
{"type": "imu_gesture_response", "gesture": "head_up", "timestamp": 1708963201234}
```

#### `imu_unsubscribe_gesture` _(under construction)_

```json
{"type": "imu_unsubscribe_gesture"}
```

### I2S audio

Mentra Live routes Android-side audio through the MCU via I2S. The path must be opened before audio can play, and audio must use `AudioManager.STREAM_NOTIFICATION`.

#### `enable_i2s` / `enable_android_audio`

```json
{"type": "enable_i2s"}
```

Both names are aliases; either works. No response.

#### `disable_i2s` / `disable_android_audio`

```json
{"type": "disable_i2s"}
```

No response.

---

### RGB LED control

Controls the RGB LEDs on the glasses themselves (not the local MTK recording LED). See [features/led-control.md](features/led-control.md) for the layered architecture.

#### `rgb_led_control_on`

```json
{
  "type": "rgb_led_control_on",
  "led": 4,
  "ontime": 500,
  "offtime": 500,
  "count": 3,
  "brightness": 200
}
```

| Field        | Type | Default                                           | Range                                     |
| ------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `led`        | int  | 0 (red)                                           | 0=red, 1=green, 2=blue, 3=orange, 4=white |
| `ontime`     | int  | 1000                                              | ≥ 0 ms                                    |
| `offtime`    | int  | 1000                                              | ≥ 0 ms                                    |
| `count`      | int  | 1                                                 | ≥ 0 cycles                                |
| `brightness` | int  | `K900RgbLedController.DEFAULT_RGB_LED_BRIGHTNESS` | 0-255                                     |

#### `rgb_led_control_off`

```json
{"type": "rgb_led_control_off"}
```

#### `rgb_led_photo_flash`

```json
{"type": "rgb_led_photo_flash", "duration": 5000, "brightness": 200}
```

White flash for photo capture. `duration` defaults to 5000 ms.

#### `rgb_led_video_solid`

```json
{"type": "rgb_led_video_solid", "brightness": 200}
```

Solid white for video recording. Internal duration is 30 minutes — the recorder turns the LED off explicitly when recording stops.

All four commands respond with either `<command>_response` (success: `true`) or `rgb_led_control_error` if the device doesn't support RGB LEDs or validation fails.

---

### Gallery

#### `query_gallery_status`

```json
{"type": "query_gallery_status"}
```

Returns counts via `FileManager`. If the camera is busy (recording or streaming), the response reports zeros so the phone won't try to sync incomplete files.

```json
{
  "type": "gallery_status",
  "photos": 25,
  "videos": 5,
  "total": 30,
  "total_size": 2147483648,
  "has_content": true
}
```

When the camera is busy, an additional context field appears (`camera_busy`: `"video"` or `"stream"`). The phone SDK exposes this as `cameraBusy: true` and `cameraBusyReason`.

---

### Settings

#### `set_photo_mode`

```json
{"type": "set_photo_mode", "mode": "save_locally"}
```

Response:

```json
{"type": "set_photo_mode_ack", "mode": "save_locally"}
```

#### `button_video_recording_setting`

```json
{"type": "button_video_recording_setting", "params": {"width": 1920, "height": 1080, "fps": 30}}
```

Persists the resolution/fps used when the hardware camera button starts a video.

#### `button_max_recording_time`

```json
{"type": "button_max_recording_time", "minutes": 10}
```

#### `button_photo_setting`

```json
{"type": "button_photo_setting", "size": "high"}
```

`size` is one of `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `max`. Legacy values `small`, `large`, and `full` are normalized on ingest.

`size` is one of `small`, `medium`, `large`.

Enables/disables the privacy LED during button-triggered capture.

#### `button_mode_setting`

```json
{"type": "button_mode_setting", "mode": "normal"}
```

Deprecated/reserved. Current ASG Client does not use this command to switch between photo and video behavior. Use `save_in_gallery_mode` to control whether hardware-button presses also capture locally, and use the photo/video setting commands above to configure short-press photo and long-press video captures.

#### `camera_fov_setting` (Mentra Live / K900-class hardware)

```json
{"type": "camera_fov_setting", "params": {"fov": 118, "roi_position": 0}}
```

Persists the FOV/ROI, applies them to the camera HAL via `DevApi.setCameraFov`, and restarts the HAL. After the restart cooldown (`CameraRestartCooldown`), ASG emits `settings_ack` with `status: "ready"` and `hardware_applied: true`. Persist-only fallbacks on non-K900 hardware emit `hardware_applied: false`.

The missing/factory base is the full sensor at `fov: 118`, `roi_position: 0`; existing saved values are preserved.

#### `camera_fov_override` / `camera_fov_override_release`

```json
{"type":"camera_fov_override","request_id":"settings-1","params":{"lease_id":"fov-1","fov":82,"roi_position":1,"ttl_ms":300000}}
```

Applies a memory-only FOV/ROI lease without changing the persistent base. Re-sending the same lease and configuration refreshes its TTL without restarting the HAL. `camera_fov_override_release` takes the same `lease_id` and restores the base; releasing a stale lease is a no-op. Expiry is capped at ten minutes.

#### `camera_tuning_config` (Mentra Live / K900-class hardware)

```json
{"type": "camera_tuning_config", "anr": false, "gain": false}
```

Configures camera HAL tuning (ANR / pixsmart gain) without a reboot. ASG persists the flags (`camera_anr_enabled` / `camera_gain_enabled`, both default `true`) and relays them as a `camconfig` broadcast to SystemUI's `CTReceiver`. Both fields are optional; an omitted field keeps the stored value.

- `anr`: `true` = ANR (Adaptive Noise Reduction) on; `false` = ANR off.
- `gain`: `true` = stock gain params; `false` = pixsmart gain-off params.

**Scan-mode convention**: send `{"anr": false, "gain": false}` to disable ANR and gain for sharper barcode/QR/text captures, and `{"anr": true, "gain": true}` to restore defaults.

ASG replies with `settings_ack` (`setting: "camera_tuning"`, `status: "applied"`) echoing the effective `anr`/`gain` values. The persisted flags are re-applied at boot and after any `camera_fov_setting` HAL restart so the tuning survives reboots and FOV changes.

---

### BLE configuration

#### `set_ble_mtu`

```json
{"type": "set_ble_mtu", "mtu": 244}
```

Adjusts the file packet size to fit the MTU just negotiated by the phone. Effective payload is `mtu - 3` bytes, minus 32 bytes of K900 protocol overhead.

---

### Power

#### `shutdown`

```json
{"type": "shutdown"}
```

Stops any active video recording (to finalize the moov atom) before calling `SysControl.shut()`.

#### `reboot`

```json
{"type": "reboot"}
```

Same active-recording cleanup, then `SysControl.reboot()`.

---

### Session lifecycle (sent by the phone app)

#### `phone_ready`

```json
{"type": "phone_ready"}
```

The phone announces it has connected. Glasses respond with `glasses_ready`, then 500 ms later auto-send WiFi status and hotspot status, and claim RGB LED control authority from the BES chip.

```json
{"type": "glasses_ready", "timestamp": 1708963201234}
```

#### `auth_token`

```json
{"type": "auth_token", "coreToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..."}
```

Response:

```json
{"type": "token_status", "success": true}
```

Empty token returns `token_status` with `success: false`.

#### `user_email`

Sets user identity for Sentry reporting context. No response.

```json
{"type": "user_email", "email": "user@example.com"}
```

#### `service_heartbeat`

```json
{"type": "service_heartbeat", "timestamp": 1708963201234, "heartbeat_counter": 42}
```

Resets the service heartbeat timeout. No response.

#### `ping`

```json
{"type": "ping"}
```

Also resets the heartbeat timeout. Response:

```json
{"type": "pong"}
```

#### `keep_awake`

No-op keep-alive (used during OTA install windows). No response.

```json
{"type": "keep_awake"}
```

#### `transfer_complete`

Phone confirms a media file BLE transfer finished.

```json
{"type": "transfer_complete", "fileName": "photo_001.jpg", "success": true}
```

`fileName` is required. No response.

#### `save_in_gallery_mode`

Toggles whether hardware-button presses save photos/videos locally (gallery mode). See [features/button-press-system.md](features/button-press-system.md).

```json
{"type": "save_in_gallery_mode", "active": true}
```

Persisted via `AsgSettings.setSaveInGalleryMode`.

#### `upload_incident_logs`

```json
{"type": "upload_incident_logs", "incidentId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000", "apiBaseUrl": ""}
```

| Field        | Type   | Required | Description              |
| ------------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------ |
| `incidentId` | string | yes      | Backend incident id      |
| `apiBaseUrl` | string | no       | Override server base URL |

With WiFi: POSTs the last 600 logcat lines plus BES firmware logs to `<base>/api/client/reports/<incidentId>/artifacts`. Without WiFi: relays the same artifact payloads to the phone over two sequential K900 BLE file transfers; the phone POSTs them.

#### `ota_start`

User accepted an OTA update.

```json
{"type": "ota_start"}
```

Optionally, the phone can supply a custom manifest URL for this install attempt:

```json
{"type": "ota_start", "ota_version_url": "https://staging.ota.mentraglass.com/staging_live_version.json"}
```

When `ota_version_url` is omitted, ASG uses the compiled production default. When provided, it must be a non-empty `http` or `https` URL.

On receipt, ASG sends `ota_start_ack` before version checks or downloads:

```json
{"type": "ota_start_ack", "timestamp": 1708963201234}
```

Progress, completion, and failure are reported with `ota_status`:

```json
{
  "type": "ota_status",
  "sid": "ota-1708963201234",
  "ts": 3,
  "cs": 1,
  "st": "apk",
  "sq": ["apk", "mtk", "bes"],
  "phase": "download",
  "sp": 42,
  "op": 14,
  "status": "in_progress"
}
```

Compact keys keep BLE payloads small: `sid` = `session_id`, `ts` = `total_steps`, `cs` = `current_step`, `st` = `step_type`, `sq` = `step_sequence`, `sp` = `step_percent`, `op` = `overall_percent`, `err` = `error_message`. Current ASG uses `ota_status`; `ota_progress` is legacy.

If `OtaHelper` isn't initialized yet (can happen right after APK install), the handler retries up to 4 times with 2 s backoff. After exhausting retries it sends:

```json
{
  "type": "ota_status",
  "session_id": "",
  "total_steps": 0,
  "current_step": 0,
  "step_type": "apk",
  "phase": "download",
  "step_percent": 0,
  "overall_percent": 0,
  "status": "failed",
  "error_message": "OTA service failed to initialize. Please restart glasses and try again."
}
```

#### `ota_query_status`

Requests the current OTA session state. ASG replies with `ota_status`; if no session is active, the status is `idle`.

```json
{"type": "ota_query_status"}
```

Idle response:

```json
{
  "type": "ota_status",
  "status": "idle",
  "total_steps": 0,
  "current_step": 0,
  "step_type": "apk",
  "phase": "download",
  "step_percent": 0,
  "overall_percent": 0
}
```

#### `ota_update_response` (deprecated)

Legacy accept/reject prompt, kept for older phone app versions. If `accepted` is `true`, delegates to `ota_start`.

```json
{"type": "ota_update_response", "accepted": true}
```

---

### K900 protocol passthroughs

The K900 microcontroller frames messages as `{"C": "<cmd>", "B": {...}, "V": 1}`. These are parsed by `K900CommandHandler` (not registered in `CommandHandlerRegistry` like the others — they're dispatched from the K900 protocol detector). Most are inbound-only and don't accept payloads from the phone, but a few translate to outbound JSON events:

| Inbound `C`           | Meaning                                              | Outbound (if any)                         |

| `cs_flts`             | File-transfer ACK                                    | (handled internally)                      |
| `sr_swst`             | Switch status report                                 | `switch_status`                           |
| `sr_tpevt`            | Touch event report                                   | `touch_event`                             |
| `sr_fbvol`            | Swipe volume status                                  | `swipe_volume_status`                     |
| `hm_ota`              | BES OTA authorization response                       | (handled internally)                      |
| `hs_ntfy`             | Hardware notification (newer firmware button format) | `button_press`                            |
| `sr_vad`              | Voice Activity Detection event                       | (logged only)                             |
| `hs_syvr`             | System version report                                | (cached, triggers `request_version` push) |
| `sr_btaddr`           | BT MAC address                                       | (persisted to system properties)          |

## Debug interface (intent broadcast)

For ADB-based testing and debug APKs.

### Intent actions

| Action                                             | Direction | Extras                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `com.mentra.asg_client.ACTION_SEND_COMMAND`        | inbound   | `json` (string) — the command JSON                       |
| `com.mentra.asg_client.ACTION_REGISTER_LISTENER`   | inbound   | `packageName` (string) — package to deliver responses to |
| `com.mentra.asg_client.ACTION_UNREGISTER_LISTENER` | inbound   | `packageName` (string)                                   |
| `com.mentra.asg_client.ACTION_COMMAND_RESPONSE`    | outbound  | `json` (string) — the response JSON                      |

The first three actions are declared in `AndroidManifest.xml` with the `IntentCommandReceiver`. `ACTION_COMMAND_RESPONSE` is an outgoing-only action — debug APKs declare a receiver for it themselves.

### ADB examples

```bash
# Ping
adb shell am broadcast -a com.mentra.asg_client.ACTION_SEND_COMMAND \
  --es json '{"type":"ping","mId":12345}'

# Take a photo (direct upload)
adb shell am broadcast -a com.mentra.asg_client.ACTION_SEND_COMMAND \
  --es json '{"type":"take_photo","requestId":"test1","packageName":"com.test","webhookUrl":"https://example.com/upload","authToken":"Bearer xyz"}'

# Start a stream
adb shell am broadcast -a com.mentra.asg_client.ACTION_SEND_COMMAND \
  --es json '{"type":"start_stream","streamUrl":"rtmp://1.2.3.4/live/stream","streamId":"s1"}'

# Enable I2S audio
adb shell am broadcast -a com.mentra.asg_client.ACTION_SEND_COMMAND \
  --es json '{"type":"enable_i2s"}'

# Register a debug listener
adb shell am broadcast -a com.mentra.asg_client.ACTION_REGISTER_LISTENER \
  --es packageName "com.example.testapp"
```

### Receiving responses

```xml
<receiver android:name=".DebugResponseReceiver" android:enabled="true" android:exported="true">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.mentra.asg_client.ACTION_COMMAND_RESPONSE" />
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>
```

```java
public class DebugResponseReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
    @Override public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        String json = intent.getStringExtra("json");
        Log.d("Debug", "Response: " + json);
    }
}
```
