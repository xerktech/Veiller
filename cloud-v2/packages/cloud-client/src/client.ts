/**
 * @fileoverview The top-level `CloudClient`: wiring only, no behavior.
 *
 * `new CloudClient(config)` resolves the server addresses (proxy-aware), builds
 * the shared REST helpers, and constructs the three modules in dependency order
 * (auth first, since runtime and core both pull their Bearer through it). All the
 * actual logic lives in the modules under `./modules/**`; this file just hands
 * each one its dependencies and exposes the three modules as readonly fields.
 *
 * It also owns the two cross-cutting concerns the design says belong in one
 * place: the logger (so a host has a single hook for every module's logs) and the
 * reconnect/backoff settings (so the live socket's timing is tuned here, not
 * scattered across the runtime internals).
 *
 * See docs/issues/004-cloud-client/design.md ("The top-level CloudClient").
