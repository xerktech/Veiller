/**
 * @fileoverview Public entry for `@mentra/cloud-client` (the root, shared build).
 *
 * This is the platform-agnostic import: it exposes `CloudClient` plus the public
 * config, transport, error, and logger types a host needs to construct and use
 * it. The `react-native` and `node` subpath imports wrap this with their own
 * transports pre-wired.
 *
 * Wire/protocol types (`AudioSubscription`, `TranscriptionData`, the message
 * unions) are NOT re-exported here: a host imports those from
 * `@mentra/cloud-protocol` directly, so there is one source of truth and
 * the client cannot drift from what the cloud accepts.
 *
 * See docs/issues/004-cloud-client/spec.md and design.md.
