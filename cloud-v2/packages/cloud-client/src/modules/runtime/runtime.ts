/**
 * @fileoverview `cloud.runtime`: the live session module.
 *
 * This is wiring only. It implements the public `RuntimeModule` by delegating to
 * five collaborators and routing messages between them:
 *   - connection: owns the WebSocket, the handshake, reconnect, and liveness.
 *   - emitter: the one typed event emitter the public `on*` methods wrap.
 *   - subscriptions: the REST full-replace writer with the version counter.
 *   - camera: managed photo/stream (REST request, await the WebSocket push).
 *   - audio: the UDP audio path (encrypt each frame, hand bytes to the socket).
 *   - tts: runtime TTS source preparation for host playback.
 *
 * Keeping the orchestration here, and the mechanics in the collaborators, means
 * each piece is testable on its own and this file reads as the protocol flow:
 * connect, route inbound messages to events, re-send subscriptions on reconnect.
 *
 * See docs/issues/004-cloud-client/spec.md ("cloud.runtime") and design.md.
