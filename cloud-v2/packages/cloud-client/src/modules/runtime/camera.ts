/**
 * @fileoverview Camera: the managed-photo and managed-stream features, each a
 * REST request followed by awaiting the matching WebSocket push.
 *
 * Both flows are client-initiated REST on the runtime domain (any pod serves
 * them, no coupling to the audio session). The cloud is not in the image byte
 * path: it brokers a presigned upload and notifies the phone over the WebSocket
 * when capture completes. So each request here records a pending promise keyed by
 * `requestId` and resolves it when the matching push arrives, or rejects it on an
 * error push or a timeout.
 *
 * Only managed photo awaits a push (`photo.ready` / `photo.error`); managed
 * stream is fully answered by the REST response, so it just returns the
 * provisioned coordinates.
 *
 * See docs/issues/002-cloud-runtime/camera/spec.md and
 * docs/issues/004-cloud-client/design.md ("Camera").
