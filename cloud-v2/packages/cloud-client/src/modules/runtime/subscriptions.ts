/**
 * @fileoverview The audio subscription REST writer, with the version counter.
 *
 * Subscriptions move over REST (not the WebSocket) so the client gets
 * request/response and the WebSocket stays a downstream push channel. This class
 * owns the full-replace semantics: every change ships the entire desired set,
 * not a diff, so the cloud never has to reconcile partial updates.
 *
 * Two fields exist purely to survive the legacy scars the cloud guards against:
 *   - `version`: a monotonic counter the client bumps on every change, so the
 *     cloud can discard an out-of-order arrival (a retried or reordered write
 *     cannot clobber a newer set).
 *   - `sessionId`: tied to the current session from `connection.ack`, so a write
 *     from a stale session is ignored by the cloud.
 *
 * See docs/issues/002-cloud-runtime/audio/wire.md ("Subscription REST endpoint")
 * and docs/issues/004-cloud-client/design.md ("Subscriptions").
