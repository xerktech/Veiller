/**
 * @fileoverview `cloud.core`: the device's stateless v2 REST calls.
 *
 * This is the simplest module: no live connection and no session state, so any
 * cloud pod can serve any call here. Each request goes through the shared HTTP
 * helper, which attaches the access token from `cloud.auth` as the Bearer, so
 * core never touches credentials itself.
 *
 * Today it exposes the miniapp lookups the device needs at launch plus the
 * unified report submission surface. It is meant to grow as miniapp-service and
 * other core resources are specced.
 *
 * Guardrail: this is device-facing only. It deliberately carries none of the
 * Dev Console / OEM Portal / store web UI surface; those are separate clients.
 *
 * See docs/issues/004-cloud-client/spec.md ("cloud.core") and design.md
 * ("src/modules/core/core.ts").
