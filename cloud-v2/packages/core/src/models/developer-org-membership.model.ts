 * Per-(org, user) role, stored and owned entirely in our DB. Roles are uniform:
 * owner | admin | member — there is no special "creator". `DeveloperOrg.ownerUserId`
 * is only a created-by pointer and does NOT grant the owner role. An org may have
 * many owners; the console enforces that at least one owner always remains (you
 * cannot demote or remove the last owner).
 *
 * Keyed by WorkOS userId. A user with no row resolves to `member` by default.
 * WorkOS is not consulted for roles — it remains identity/login + the member
 * roster only. The permission tier is a Mentra console concept.
