/**
 * @fileoverview `refreshTokens` collection. One document per active session.
 *
 * Stores the HMAC-SHA256 hash (not the plaintext) of each refresh token Mentra
 * has issued. The plaintext exists only on the SDK that received it; if the
 * DB leaks, the hashes are not directly usable because the HMAC key
 * (`REFRESH_TOKEN_PEPPER` env var) lives outside the DB.
 *
 * **Why not bcrypt/argon2.** Those exist to make low-entropy human passwords
 * expensive to brute-force. Refresh tokens are 256-bit random opaque
 * strings; a single SHA-256 already costs ~2^256 to forge. HMAC with a
 * server-held pepper protects against DB-only leaks just as well, with no
 * per-refresh CPU cost.
 *
 * **Rotation.** Every successful refresh deletes the old document and inserts
 * a new one. A token can only be used once. Reusing a previously-rotated
 * token (e.g. by a thief who grabbed it before the legitimate client
 * refreshed) yields `invalid_grant`, surfacing the breach to the legitimate
 * client on its next refresh attempt.
 *
 * **TTL.** A TTL index on `expiresAt` lets Mongo auto-delete expired
 * sessions; no background cleanup job needed.
 *
 * Spec: docs/issues/001-oem-auth/design.md ("Data model" / "refreshTokens")
