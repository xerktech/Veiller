/**
 * @fileoverview `refreshTokens` collection. One document per active session.
 *
 * Stores the HMAC-SHA256 hash (not the plaintext) of each refresh token Mentra
 * has issued. The plaintext exists only on the SDK that received it; if the
 * DB leaks, the hashes are not directly usable because the HMAC key
 * (`REFRESH_TOKEN_PEPPER` env var) lives outside the DB.
 *
 * **Why not bcrypt/argon2.** Those exist to make low-entropy human passwords
 * expensive to brute-force. Refresh tokens are 256-bit random opaque
 * strings; a single SHA-256 already costs ~2^256 to forge. HMAC with a
 * server-held pepper protects against DB-only leaks just as well, with no
 * per-refresh CPU cost.
 *
 * **Rotation.** Every successful refresh rotates the stored hash in place and
 * records the presented hash in `prevTokenHash`. A rotated-away token stays
 * honored until its successor is first USED (OS-1703): a client that sent a
 * refresh but never received the response (killed mid-rotation, dropped
 * connection) still holds the predecessor, and re-presenting it rotates again
 * instead of bricking the session. The displaced successor is retained as one
 * bounded alternate so either response from a duplicate refresh remains
 * usable until the client presents one branch. Anything older than the
 * immediate predecessor still yields `invalid_grant`.
 *
 * **TTL.** A TTL index on `expiresAt` lets Mongo auto-delete expired
 * sessions; no background cleanup job needed.
 *
 * Spec: docs/issues/001-oem-auth/design.md ("Data model" / "refreshTokens")
