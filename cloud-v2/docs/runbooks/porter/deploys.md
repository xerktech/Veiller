# Porter deploys

How code becomes running pods in cloud-v2. Covers our deploy model, env
layering, and what changes when you `porter apply`.

## Branch to environment mapping

Cloud V2 deploys use one Porter app per environment in the AWS us-west-2
cluster:

| Branch | Workflow | Porter app | Manifest | Public hosts |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dev` | `cloud-v2-dev.yml` | `cloud-dev` | `porter.dev.yaml` | `core.dev.us-west-2.mentraglass.com`, `runtime.dev.us-west-2.mentraglass.com` |
| `staging` | `cloud-v2-staging.yml` | `cloud-staging` | `porter.staging.yaml` | `core.staging.us-west-2.mentraglass.com`, `runtime.staging.us-west-2.mentraglass.com` |
| `main` | `cloud-v2-prod.yml` | `cloud-prod` | `porter.prod.yaml` | `core.mentraglass.com`, `runtime.mentraglass.com` |

Each workflow also supports `workflow_dispatch`, which lets us deploy a PR
branch into one of these environments for validation before merging.

`cloud-debug` is intentionally outside this promotion path. Treat it as an
explicit shared debugging environment and do not use it as a default test
target unless the person currently using it agrees.

## The deploy model

Each Porter app has the same service layout. All services share one Docker
image — each just runs a different process from it:

| Service | Run | HTTP port | UDP port |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `core` | `bun packages/core/src/index.ts` | 3000 | — |
| `runtime` | `bun packages/runtime/src/index.ts` | 3001 | 8000 |

(The proxy service from `packages/proxy/` joins once it has real code.)

This shape is in the environment-specific `porter.*.yaml` manifests. The build is in
[`docker/Dockerfile`](../../../docker/Dockerfile). Note the share-an-image
approach — single build, multiple entry points. v1 was monolithic; v2's
three-process model could have been three Docker images, but one image
with `run:` overrides is simpler and the cost is negligible (a few extra
MB per service since they all bundle the same node_modules).

## What `porter apply -f porter.<env>.yaml` actually does

1. Reads the environment manifest.
2. Builds the Docker image (Dockerfile multi-stage build).
3. Pushes to our AWS ECR — `042724764545.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/...`.
4. Creates a new app **revision** (Porter's term for a deploy).
5. Triggers a rolling update — new pods come up, old pods drain (10s
   `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`).
6. Liveness + readiness probes gate the new pods before traffic.

Typical apply takes 2–4 min (mostly the Docker build; small code changes
get layer-cached so re-builds are faster).

## Where do env vars come from?

Three layers, in increasing priority:

1. **Service-level `env:` in `porter.yaml`** — non-secret values like
   `LOG_STDOUT_JSON=true`, `AUDIO_UDP_PORT=8000`.
2. **Linked env groups** (referenced in `envGroups:` in `porter.yaml`).
   We use `cloud-v2-dev-doppler`, `cloud-v2-staging-doppler`, and
   `cloud-v2-prod-doppler`. See
   [`doppler/porter-integration.md`](../doppler/porter-integration.md).
3. **App-level env** (rarely set) — overrides env-group values per-app.

Verify what a pod actually sees:

```bash
porter env pull --app cloud-dev --merged | grep MENTRA_JWT
# Shows the merged env, including env-group values
```

## Watching a deploy

```bash
# Live logs from one service (Ctrl+C to stop)
porter app logs cloud-dev --service core
porter app logs cloud-dev --service runtime

# Historical logs
porter app logs cloud-dev --service core --since 30m
porter app logs cloud-dev --service core --limit 100
```

## Rollback

```bash
# Roll back to the previous successful revision
porter app rollback cloud-dev

# Roll back to a specific revision number
porter app rollback cloud-dev --revision 5
```

Rollbacks are instant — Porter just shifts the Helm release back to the
previous values. Use this when a fresh deploy made things worse.

## Updating env vars without a code change

If you only need to change an env var (no code change), you can:

```bash
# Change in Doppler — auto-syncs to Porter via the integration.
doppler secrets set FOO=bar --config dev_aws

# Trigger a redeploy so pods pick up the new env.
porter apply -f porter.dev.yaml
```

Pods don't auto-restart on env changes (avoids cascading restarts). You
have to re-apply.

## Public URLs

The HTTP/WS endpoints are auto-provisioned by Porter via the cluster's
ALB ingress. Hostnames are derived from `<service>-<project-id>-<target-id>.onporter.run`:

| Service | URL |
| --- | --- |
| core | https://core-16427-87f939d6-fldz0e8y.onporter.run |
| audio | https://audio-16427-87f939d6-e4galhhw.onporter.run |
| audio WS | wss://audio-16427-87f939d6-e4galhhw.onporter.run/ws/session |

To get the URLs programmatically:

```bash
porter kubectl -- get ingress -l porter.run/app-name=cloud-v2
```

For UDP, see [`udp-nlb-aws.md`](./udp-nlb-aws.md) — separate Service +
NLB needed.

## Custom domains

(TODO when we set them up.) v1 used Cloudflare CNAMEs pointing at the
Porter ALB hostnames. We'd do the same for cloud-v2 — e.g.,
`audio.cloud-v2.mentra.glass` → Porter ALB ingress.

## Health checks

Both services expose:

- `GET /healthz` — liveness, returns 200 if responsive
- `GET /ready` — readiness, returns 200 if all deps connected

K8s readiness probes hit `/ready` on a 15s initial-delay + every poll
afterwards. A pod that goes unready gets removed from the service's
endpoints (no more traffic) but is NOT restarted. K8s liveness probes
hit `/healthz`; failures restart the pod.

We set `/ready` to be the slower check (Mongo ping, Redis ping). `/healthz`
just returns "ok" — no work — so liveness can't false-positive under load.

(Lesson from v1 issue 057.)

## Resource limits

Defined in `porter.yaml` per service:

```yaml
- name: core
  cpuCores: 1
  ramMegabytes: 1024
- name: audio
  cpuCores: 2
  ramMegabytes: 2048
```

Bump these in `porter.yaml` and re-apply when:
- OOM kills happen (check with `porter app logs ... --search OOMKilled`)
- CPU throttling shows up in metrics (the event-loop-lag gauge)
- You're scaling user count beyond what the current size handles

## Replica count

By default Porter runs 1 replica per service. To scale up:

```yaml
- name: audio
  instances: 3  # multi-replica
```

For audio specifically, multi-replica is REAL multi-pod, exercised by the
multi-pod integration tests. UDP and WS distribute across replicas via
the cluster's LB layer (ALB for WS, NLB for UDP).

## Gotchas

### Builds take forever after a node_modules change

Docker layer cache invalidates on `bun.lock` change → full reinstall.
Expected — the install is ~60s. If it's taking longer, your local Docker
might be low on cache disk; `docker system prune -a` helps.

### "ImagePullBackOff" after deploy

Usually means the build succeeded but Porter pushed to a registry the
cluster can't read from. Check:

```bash
porter kubectl -- get pods -l porter.run/app-name=cloud-v2
porter kubectl -- describe pod <pod-name> | grep -A5 Events
```

Fix is usually in the cluster's ECR auth — talk to whoever set up Porter.

### Deploy succeeds but pods crash-loop on env

Most often: a placeholder URL in Doppler (e.g., MONGO_URL = TBD_PROVISION
something). Check:

```bash
porter app logs cloud-v2 --service core --search "error" --limit 20
```

Update Doppler, re-apply.

### Deploys are slow because of `bun run typecheck` in the Dockerfile

The Dockerfile runs `bun run typecheck` as a build-time gate so we don't
deploy broken types. Costs ~10s. Worth it. Skip via `--build-arg
SKIP_TYPECHECK=true` only if you're debugging the deploy itself.

(TODO: actually wire that build arg if it becomes useful.)
