# Cloud V2 issues: spec status

Index and status tracker for the things we own, organized by product (matching
the [overhaul plan](../mentra-overhaul-plan.md) taxonomy and diagram). Use this
to see at a glance what is properly specced and what still needs speccing.

Keep the status column in sync with each doc's own `**Status:**` line as work
lands.

## Legend

- **Implemented**: specced and built in v2 (may still be under doc review).
- **Specced**: spec and design exist and are review-ready; buildable.
- **Spiked**: research/spike only, surfaces open questions; needs a real spec.
- **Draft**: an early draft exists, not yet reviewed.
- **Stub**: placeholder folder only; not started.
- **Blocked**: waiting on an open decision (see "Open decisions").

## Status

| Issue / service | Status | What exists / what is left |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[001-cloud-core](./001-cloud-core/)** | | proprietary cloud product |
| [auth](./001-cloud-core/auth/) | Mixed | the auth system, in 5 docs: `concepts` (primer), `spec` + `design` (Specced), `oem-auth` (Implemented). See rows below |
| [auth / spec + design](./001-cloud-core/auth/spec.md) | Specced | [spec.md](./001-cloud-core/auth/spec.md) (endpoints + tokens) and [design.md](./001-cloud-core/auth/design.md) (e2e code changes + the identity model, migration bridge, and miniapp auto-auth + injection): exchange, refresh, miniapp-token mint, JWKS. Open: API-key role |
| [auth / oem-auth](./001-cloud-core/auth/oem-auth.md) | Implemented | the OEM-JWT exchange mechanics, built in v2, e2e verified with `test-oem`. Left: finalize doc review |
| [oem-service](./001-cloud-core/oem-service/) | Stub | needs spec |
| [miniapp-service](./001-cloud-core/miniapp-service/) | Draft | placeholder plus [preinstalled-local-miniapps.md](./001-cloud-core/miniapp-service/preinstalled-local-miniapps.md), superseded/expanded by [011-miniapp-registry](./011-miniapp-registry/) |
| [dev-console-service](./001-cloud-core/dev-console-service/) | Stub | needs spec |
| [storage-service](./001-cloud-core/storage-service/) | Stub | needs spec (wrapper around swappable blob providers; used by miniapp-service, dev-console-service) |
| **[002-cloud-runtime](./002-cloud-runtime/)** | | self-hostable runtime product |
| [architecture + design](./002-cloud-runtime/architecture.md) | Written | [architecture.md](./002-cloud-runtime/architecture.md): the big picture (scaling rules, session lifecycle, e2e trace). [design.md](./002-cloud-runtime/design.md): the `@mentra/cloud-runtime` package build map + signatures + current state |
| [protocol (transport)](./002-cloud-runtime/protocol.md) | Locked | contract locked (`/api` paths, envelope with `timestamp`, REST subscriptions 2a with `sessionId`+`version`, UDP encryption); zod types written in `@mentra/cloud-runtime/protocol` |
| [audio](./002-cloud-runtime/audio/) | Specced / partial | spec + design (proposal, under review); pipeline partially built (UDP + Redis + Soniox, phone WS). Subscription transport decided (2a: REST + stream entry); UDP encryption documented |
| [camera (managed photo + stream)](./002-cloud-runtime/camera/) | Specced | [spec.md](./002-cloud-runtime/camera/spec.md): presigned-upload photo (cloud out of the byte path, storage-event completion, `photo.ready` push) + client-controlled managed stream |
| **[003-cloud-proxy](./003-cloud-proxy/)** | Stub | needs spike (non-blocking; cloud-client is proxy-aware via endpoint config) |
| **[004-cloud-client](./004-cloud-client/)** | Specced / partial | [architecture.md](./004-cloud-client/architecture.md): the big picture (how a miniapp reaches the cloud, what the cloud-client is and why, auth for Mentra + OEMs, decisions). [spec.md](./004-cloud-client/spec.md): the public API. [design.md](./004-cloud-client/design.md): how it's built (transports, connection lifecycle, token refresh). [udp-liveness-fallback](./004-cloud-client/udp-liveness-fallback/): partially implemented reversible UDP/WS audio transport selection; phone harness and cross-pod probe ack routing remain |
| **[005-websites](./005-websites/)** | | web frontends |
| [console](./005-websites/console/) | Draft | see [013-console2](./013-console2/) |
| [miniapp-store](./005-websites/miniapp-store/) | Stub | needs spec |
| [oem-portal](./005-websites/oem-portal/) | Draft | spike exists; current proposal is [014-enterprise-portal](./014-enterprise-portal/) |
| **[006-dev-toolkit](./006-dev-toolkit/)** | | developer toolkit |
| [local-sdk](./006-dev-toolkit/local-sdk/) | Spiked | findings + open questions, not yet a proposal. Left: spec + design |
| [cli](./006-dev-toolkit/cli/) | Draft | see [012-mentra-cli-v2](./012-mentra-cli-v2/) |
| **[007-runtime-auth-independence](./007-runtime-auth-independence/)** | Draft | runtime auth split issue: make Runtime Services able to accept trusted runtime tokens without live Core dependency; define optional Core endpoint/client behavior |
| **[008-subscription-seed-overlap](./008-subscription-seed-overlap/)** | Draft | subscription replay/seed overlap issue: prevent duplicated seed and live transcript events when a miniapp subscribes during an active stream |
| **[009-miniapp-auto-auth](./009-miniapp-auto-auth/)** | Draft | miniapp backend auth: host-minted audience-scoped miniapp tokens exposed through `session.auth`, without leaking Core/runtime credentials |
| **[010-dev-miniapp-auth-audience](./010-dev-miniapp-auth-audience/)** | Draft | dev-slot versus real-package auth audience issue: keep `com.dev` routing while minting backend tokens only for trusted dev registration package names |
| **[011-miniapp-registry](./011-miniapp-registry/)** | Draft | package, bundle, release channel, submission, and preinstalled registry data model plus device auto-update contract |
| **[012-mentra-cli-v2](./012-mentra-cli-v2/)** | Draft | new `@mentra/cli` shape, short commands, CLI login, developer signing key, dev attestation, publish flow |

| **[014-enterprise-portal](./014-enterprise-portal/)** | Draft | separate enterprise/OEM portal with `EnterpriseOrg`, `EnterpriseMembership`, and standards-aligned `TrustedIssuer` model |
| **[015-internal-admin](./015-internal-admin/)** | Draft | internal admin site and admin CLI for reviews, incidents, preinstalled registry, admin audit logs |
| **[016-miniapp-signing-and-dev-attestation](./016-miniapp-signing-and-dev-attestation/)** | In progress | PRD and implementation issue for `@mentra/cli` developer signing keys, signed release metadata, and signed dev attestations for miniapp auto-auth |
| **[019-incident-reporting-migration](./019-incident-reporting-migration/)** | Implemented / partial | initial Cloud V2 core + cloud-client + engine filing path is built. Left: durable attachment storage service, admin retrieval, runtime/cloud-log enrichment, and v1 mobile cleanup |
| **[020-glasses-status-boundary](./020-glasses-status-boundary/)** | Implemented | removed host access to raw glasses/gallery runtime stores and replaced it with typed engine read models, events, and commands |

## Open decisions

- Runtime auth split: should runtime-only cloud-client construction omit
  `cloud.core`, expose a disabled module, or use a separate RuntimeClient?
  Recently decided: audio subscription transport
  (Option 2a, REST + stream control entry, see
  [`002-cloud-runtime/audio/wire.md`](./002-cloud-runtime/audio/wire.md));
  `mentraUserId` = `users._id`; the Mentra-as-OEM core-token migration bridge.

## What to spec next (rough order)

1. Review and lock `002-cloud-runtime/protocol.md` (now includes REST
   subscriptions, UDP encryption, the corrected frame), then add the shared zod
   types in `@mentra/cloud-runtime/protocol`.
2. Spec the `004-cloud-client` runtime module (the client end of the protocol).
3. Review and split the new cross-product drafts (`011` through `015`) into
   build tasks: storage-service, miniapp-service, CLI, Console2, Portal, Admin.
4. Promote `local-sdk` from spike to spec.
