# 015 - Internal Admin Site and Admin CLI

**Status:** First admin site, release review queue, preinstalled-registry
publisher, and mutation audit log are implemented locally. Incident workflows,
admin CLI, and durable role mapping are still draft.

## Problem

Cloud v2 needs an internal admin surface for Mentra operators. This should not
live in Console2, because Console2 is developer-facing. It should also not live
inside the enterprise portal, because portal users are external customer admins.

Internal admin must replace the old dev console's review and incident workflows
and add admin control over the preinstalled miniapp registry.

## Product Boundary

```txt
admin.mentraglass.com
admin.dev.mentraglass.com
admin.staging.mentraglass.com
```

CLI:

```txt
mentra admin ...
```

or, if we want a separate package later:

```txt
@mentra/admin-cli
```

Initial preference: keep one `mentra` binary and gate admin commands by admin
auth/roles.

## Auth Direction

Use WorkOS for internal admin auth, but do not rely only on email domain for the
final system.

Current first slice:

- Reuses the Console2 WorkOS sealed session cookie.
- Allows explicit `CLOUD_CORE_ADMIN_EMAILS`.
- Allows domains from `CLOUD_CORE_ADMIN_EMAIL_DOMAINS`, defaulting to
  `mentraglass.com` for local internal builds.
- Sets `c.var.developer` from the signed-in WorkOS user and uses that identity
  in release decisions, registry revision metadata, and audit entries.

This intentionally avoids `CLOUD_CORE_ADMIN_TOKEN` for browser admin usage.
Role-based auth remains required before production admin launch.

Requirements:

- User must belong to a Mentra internal WorkOS org.
- User should usually have an `@mentraglass.com` email.
- User must have explicit admin role(s).
- Every mutation writes an audit log entry.

```ts
interface AdminPrincipal {
  identityUserId: string
  workosUserId: string
  roles: AdminRole[]
}

type AdminRole =
  | "admin_owner"
  | "app_reviewer"
  | "incident_responder"
  | "registry_admin"
  | "support_viewer"
```

## Data Models

```ts
interface AdminActionAuditLog {
  id: string
  adminUserId: string
  roleUsed: AdminRole
  action: string
  targetType: string
  targetId: string
  reason?: string
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>
  createdAt: string
}

interface ReviewQueueItem {
  id: string
  submissionId: string
  packageId: string
  bundleId: string
  status: "queued" | "in_review" | "approved" | "rejected" | "changes_requested"
  assignedAdminUserId?: string
  decisionReason?: string
  createdAt: string
  updatedAt: string
}

interface IncidentReport {
  id: string
  reporterUserId?: string
  packageId?: string
  bundleId?: string
  mobileUserId?: string
  deviceId?: string
  runtimeSessionId?: string
  status: "open" | "triaged" | "resolved" | "closed"
  severity: "low" | "medium" | "high" | "critical"
  summary: string
  createdAt: string
  updatedAt: string
}

interface IncidentTimelineEvent {
  id: string
  incidentId: string
  adminUserId?: string
  type: "comment" | "status_change" | "log_snapshot" | "linked_entity" | "resolution"
  body?: string
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>
  createdAt: string
}
```

Review data references the registry models in `011-miniapp-registry`.

## Admin Site Screens

1. Dashboard. Next.
2. Review queue. Implemented as a queue/table with approve, reject, publish.
3. Submission detail. Next; first slice uses inline row actions.
4. Package/bundle inspector. Next.
5. Preinstalled registry editor. Implemented.
6. Preinstalled registry revision history. Implemented.
7. Incident list. Next.
8. Incident detail and timeline. Next.
9. User/device/session lookup. Next.
10. Enterprise/org/issuer lookup. Next.
11. Audit log. Implemented.

## Admin CLI Commands

Initial commands should cover emergency and release operations:

```txt
mentra admin whoami
mentra admin submissions list
mentra admin submissions approve <submissionId>
mentra admin submissions reject <submissionId>
mentra admin registry list
mentra admin registry draft <registryName>
mentra admin registry promote <revisionId> --reason "..."
mentra admin incidents list
mentra admin incidents show <incidentId>
mentra admin issuers disable <trustedIssuerId> --reason "..."
```

Admin CLI must call the same Cloud Core admin APIs as admin site and produce the
same audit logs.

## User Stories

1. An app reviewer approves a submitted bundle.
2. An app reviewer requests changes with notes visible to the developer in
   Console2.
3. A registry admin promotes Local Captions to the dev preinstalled registry.
4. A registry admin rolls back a bad preinstalled registry revision.
5. An incident responder opens a report, sees linked logs/session/user/package,
   and adds timeline notes.
6. A support viewer can inspect incidents but cannot mutate package or registry
   state.
7. An admin disables a compromised trusted issuer.
8. Every admin mutation is visible in the audit log.

## API Shape

```txt
GET  /api/admin/me
GET  /api/admin/submissions
POST /api/admin/submissions/:releaseId/approve
POST /api/admin/submissions/:releaseId/reject
POST /api/admin/submissions/:releaseId/publish
GET  /api/admin/preinstalled/registries
POST /api/admin/preinstalled/registries
GET  /api/admin/preinstalled/releases
GET  /api/admin/preinstalled/registries/:registryId/revisions
POST /api/admin/preinstalled/registries/:registryId/revisions
POST /api/admin/preinstalled/registries/:registryId/revisions/:revisionId/promote
GET  /api/admin/incidents
GET  /api/admin/incidents/:id
POST /api/admin/incidents/:id/events
GET  /api/admin/audit-log
```

The incident routes remain planned; the release and preinstall routes above are
implemented.

## Faults To Test

| Fault | Expected behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `@mentraglass.com` user without role | Login allowed only if desired; admin APIs forbidden |
| Admin role revoked | Existing session loses mutation permission after refresh/check |
| Duplicate approval click | Idempotent decision or clear conflict |
| Bad preinstalled registry revision | Roll back to prior revision |
| Admin CLI mutation | Same auth, authorization, and audit log as admin site |
| Incident log source unavailable | Incident page still opens with partial data |

## Verification

Current local checks:

```txt
bun test tests/miniapp-release-lifecycle.integration.test.ts
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/health
```

The integration test covers the release state transitions that power the admin
review queue. Local HTTP smoke checks verify admin health is public and protected
admin endpoints require a Mentra/WorkOS session.

## Open Decisions

- One `mentra` binary with admin namespace vs separate `@mentra/admin-cli`.
- Whether admin site shares frontend shell/components with Console2.
- Which old incident fields must be migrated exactly from cloud v1.
- Whether internal admin auth uses the same WorkOS project as Console2/Portal or
  a separate internal project.
- How fine-grained admin roles need to be for first release.
