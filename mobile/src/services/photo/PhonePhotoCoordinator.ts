/**
 * PhonePhotoCoordinator — owns local-miniapp takePhoto() end-to-end.
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   miniapp → SDK → LocalMiniappRuntime → photo runtime hook
 *          → coordinator.takePhoto(packageName, opts)
 *            ├── (precheck) glasses connected + hasCamera
 *            ├── cloudClient.startManagedPhoto → {requestId, uploadUrl, readUrl}  (cloud-v2 runtime presign)
 *            ├── BluetoothSdk.requestPhoto(requestId, packageName, size, uploadUrl, compress, sound)
 *            └── race:
 *                  - cloudClient.awaitManagedPhotoReady(requestId) resolves on photo.ready push
 *                  - BluetoothSdk.requestPhoto rejects if terminal photo_response is an error
 *                  - handlePhotoError(requestId, code, message) rejects if MantleManager observes
 *                    the same BLE photo_response error before the native promise crosses the bridge
 *
 * `activeRequests` lets MantleManager's gated `photo_response` listener
 * short-circuit our long-poll with a typed error (CAMERA_BUSY, BATTERY_LOW,
 * etc.) instead of waiting 30s for cloud's timeout.
