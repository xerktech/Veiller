# E2E Transcription Metrics

This folder contains the live transcription delay monitor used on a real Android phone, with local audio playback and a browser dashboard.

The current production path for this harness is:

- word-level ground truth from Hugging Face word-timestamp data
- visible transcription timing from `E2E_METRIC` app logs in `adb logcat`
- live dashboard served locally by `scripts/live_word_monitor.py`
- read-only archive review served by the same script with `--read-only`
- optional public sharing via Cloudflare Tunnel

## Layout

- `scripts/live_word_monitor.py`: current live dashboard and monitor
- `results/`: NDJSON, cache, and monitor outputs

## Current Signal Source

The current live monitor primarily uses machine-readable `E2E_METRIC` log lines from the app:

- `local_transcription_received`
- `local_transcription_processed`
- `display_text_main`
- `display_store_update`
- `display_view_changed`

By default, the monitor only consumes `display_store_update` events for the `main` display view. This avoids treating dashboard-only content such as date/time ticks as caption activity.

For the current dashboard, delay is computed from:

- observed timestamp: first accepted visible word match from `display_store_update`
- expected timestamp: word **end** time from the reference data

This means a "perfect" transcription model would trend near `0 ms` by this metric.

## MacOS Setup

### 1. Install prerequisites

- Bun
- Python 3
- Android platform tools / `adb`
- `cloudflared`
- Java 17 or Android Studio JBR if you also build the app locally

Recommended installs on macOS:

```bash
brew install bun
brew install android-platform-tools
brew install cloudflared
```

### 2. Clone the repos

```bash
git clone <MentraOS repo>
git clone <LiveCaptionsOnSmartGlasses repo>
```

### 3. Install repo dependencies

For the mobile repo:

```bash
cd /path/to/MentraOS/mobile
bun install
```

For the mini app repo:

```bash
cd /path/to/LiveCaptionsOnSmartGlasses
bun install
```

### 4. Run the mini app backend

```bash
cd /path/to/LiveCaptionsOnSmartGlasses
MENTRA_LOG_LEVEL=debug bun run dev
```

### 5. Make sure the phone can use the app

You need a working MentraOS app on the phone and a path for the phone to reach the captions mini app.

Choose one:

- your hosted Mentra cloud / marketplace path
- a local development routing path you control

The phone must be able to open the captions mini app and render the `Simulated glasses` mirror view.

### 6. Run the monitor

```bash
cd /path/to/MentraOS/mobile/e2e-tests
python3 scripts/live_word_monitor.py \
  --output-dir results \
  --port 8765
```

If you need to inspect a different display lane, you can override the default filter:

```bash
python3 scripts/live_word_monitor.py \
  --output-dir results \
  --port 8765 \
  --display-view dashboard
```

If you want the monitor to verify a specific macOS output device and raise incidents when playback would route elsewhere, run it with the extra device flag:

```bash
cd /path/to/MentraOS/mobile/e2e-tests
python3 scripts/live_word_monitor.py \
  --output-dir results \
  --port 8765 \
  --audio-output-device "External Headphones"
```

Then open:

- [http://127.0.0.1:8765](http://127.0.0.1:8765)

If you only want to inspect previously captured results, start the same dashboard in read-only mode:

```bash
cd /path/to/MentraOS/mobile/e2e-tests
python3 scripts/live_word_monitor.py \
  --read-only \
  --output-dir results \
  --port 8765
```

In read-only mode, the dashboard loads history from `monitor_events.ndjson` and does not require the phone, `adb`, local audio playback, or any live collectors.

The dashboard UI now lives in `ui/` as a small React app.

For the normal static workflow, rebuild it before restarting the monitor:

```bash
cd /path/to/MentraOS/mobile/e2e-tests/ui
bun install
bun run build
```

For frontend hot reload during development, run Vite separately and start the monitor in UI dev mode:

```bash
cd /path/to/MentraOS/mobile/e2e-tests/ui
bun install
bun run dev
```

In another terminal:

```bash
cd /path/to/MentraOS/mobile/e2e-tests
python3 scripts/live_word_monitor.py \
  --output-dir results \
  --port 8765 \
  --ui-dev
```

Then keep using:

- [http://127.0.0.1:8765](http://127.0.0.1:8765)

The monitor will proxy UI requests to Vite on `127.0.0.1:5173` while still serving `/state` itself, so React edits hot reload without rebuilding `ui/dist`.

### 7. Set up Cloudflare Tunnel on the new machine

Login to the correct zone:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel login
```

Create a tunnel if needed:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel create captions
```

Create `~/.cloudflared/config.yml`:

```yaml
tunnel: <TUNNEL_ID>
credentials-file: /Users/<you>/.cloudflared/<TUNNEL_ID>.json

ingress:
  - hostname: captions.smartglasses.art
    service: http://127.0.0.1:8765
  - service: http_status:404
```

Attach DNS:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel route dns captions captions.smartglasses.art
```

Run the tunnel:

```bash
cloudflared --config /Users/<you>/.cloudflared/config.yml tunnel run captions
```

### 8. Verify the new machine

Local checks:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765
lsof -nP -iTCP:8765 -sTCP:LISTEN
```

Tunnel checks:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel info captions
```

Public check:

```bash
curl -A 'Mozilla/5.0' https://captions.smartglasses.art
```

## Notes

- The monitor server is Python, not Expo; restart it after code changes.
- The dashboard UI is a small React app under `ui/`.
- The chart is intended for incident review as well as live monitoring.
- On startup, the monitor restores recent graph history from `results/monitor_events.ndjson`, so the latency shape survives dashboard restarts.

## Incident Config

Incident thresholds now live in:

- [incident_config.toml](/Users/philippe/dev/MentraOS-philippe-OS-1274-e2e-testing-checklist/mobile/e2e-tests/incident_config.toml)

This file defines per-incident names and thresholds. Current examples:

- `drop_event`
- `captions_app_not_running`
- `audio_output_device_mismatch`
- `app_not_foreground`
- `high_average_latency`

Each incident can have its own:

- `name`
- `enabled`
- `incident_threshold_ms`
- `alert_threshold_ms`

Some incident types can also use extra fields. For example, `high_average_latency` uses:

- `window_size`
- `resolve_threshold_ms`

The monitor reads this file at startup.

For `audio_output_device_mismatch`, the thresholds live in the TOML config, but the expected device name is still provided at runtime with `--audio-output-device`. That keeps the policy shared in git while letting a MacBook and Mac mini use different local hardware.

For `captions_app_not_running`, the thresholds live in the TOML config, but the specific monitored app package is still provided at runtime with `--captions-package` and defaults to `com.mentra.captions`. The monitor opens this incident when logcat shows `SOCKET: Received app_stopped message for package: ...` for that package, and resolves it on the matching `app_started` log.

When an alert is raised, the monitor also broadcasts an Android intent to the connected phone by default. This is intended for the `internal` Android build, which registers the `com.mentra.CAPTIONS_TESTER_INCIDENT` receiver and files a normal automatic incident through the mobile app.

## Running it

### 1. Start the local captions mini app backend (optional, can instead use the deployed com.mentra.captions)

From the mini app repo:

```bash
gh repo clone Mentra-Community/LiveCaptionsOnSmartGlasses
MENTRA_LOG_LEVEL=debug bun run dev
```

Expected:

- the app server listens on `:3333`

### 2. Keep the phone and app in the right state

- Connect the Android phone over USB.
- Open MentraOS on the phone.
- Start the captions mini app.
- GO back to the home using `Simulated glasses`. The mirror view should stay visible.
- Keep the phone awake.

### 3. Start the live dashboard monitor

From the MentraOS repo:

```bash
cd mobile/e2e-tests
python3 scripts/live_word_monitor.py \
  --output-dir results \
  --port 8765
```

Open:

- local: [http://127.0.0.1:8765](http://127.0.0.1:8765)

Notes:

- backend/script changes still require restarting this Python process
- it writes cache and monitor output under `results`
- if `--audio-output-device` is set, the monitor will refuse playback unless that macOS output device is active; with `SwitchAudioSource` installed it will auto-switch first
- if startup fails because cached utterance history is on an old schema, remove or migrate `results/utterance_reports.ndjson`
- if you are editing the React dashboard, run Vite in `ui/` and add `--ui-dev` for hot reload; otherwise rebuild `ui/dist`

If you only want to review archived output:

```bash
cd mobile/e2e-tests
python3 scripts/live_word_monitor.py \
  --read-only \
  --output-dir results \
  --port 8765
```

Notes:

- this mode serves the same dashboard UI
- it reloads recent delay points, completed utterances, drop events, and recent events from disk
- it does not start playback, logcat collection, RN streaming, USB forwarding, or any adb-dependent checks

### 4. Optional: expose the dashboard publicly

Only if needed:

```bash
cloudflared --config ~/.cloudflared/config.yml tunnel run captions
```

Expected public URL:

- [https://captions.smartglasses.art](https://captions.smartglasses.art)

If that hostname shows `1033`, the tunnel runner is not alive.

Quick check:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel info captions
```

### 5. Recovery commands

If the monitor looks stale:

```bash
pkill -f 'mobile/e2e-tests/scripts/live_word_monitor.py'
cd mobile/e2e-tests
python3 scripts/live_word_monitor.py \
  --output-dir results \
  --port 8765
```

If the public URL is down:

```bash
cloudflared --config ~/.cloudflared/config.yml tunnel run captions
```

## On Mentra's mac mini

### Disable computer sleep

It should not sleep but log out and screen saver is fine

### Disable system updates

Disable the user-level automatic update settings for this account:

com.apple.SoftwareUpdate.AutomaticCheckEnabled = 0
com.apple.SoftwareUpdate.AutomaticDownload = 0
com.apple.SoftwareUpdate.AutomaticallyInstallMacOSUpdates = 0
com.apple.commerce.AutoUpdate = 0
com.apple.commerce.AutoUpdateRestartRequired = 0

Open:
System Settings > General > Software Update > Automatic Updates

Turn off:

Check for Updates
Download new updates when available
Install macOS updates
Install Security Responses and system files
That should stop both full macOS updates and the background security/system-file installs that can sometimes interfere.

### Run it

Connect the phone with a data-USB cable
Open the Captions app, go back to the home screen.

#### From your local machine

```
./mobile/e2e-tests/scripts/redeploy_mentra_mini.sh
```

That helper will:

- ssh to `mentra-mini`
- fast-forward pull the current local branch
- rebuild `mobile/e2e-tests/ui`
- restart `live_word_monitor.py` with the known-good Homebrew Python runtime
- auto-detect attached Android phones on the Mac mini and pass them as repeated `--device` flags

If you want to target specific phones explicitly, you can also pass repeatable device flags:

```sh
./mobile/e2e-tests/scripts/redeploy_mentra_mini.sh \
  --device Q92024100001877 \
  --device RFCX71TH0CR
```

#### Terminal 1

```
cd /Users/mentraconference/Documents/MentraOS/mobile/e2e-tests
python3 scripts/live_word_monitor.py --output-dir results --port 8765 --audio-output-device "External Headphones"
```

#### Terminal 2

```
cloudflared --config /Users/mentraconference/.cloudflared/config.yml tunnel run captions
```

### Misc

To login, run

```
maestro test ~/Documents/Playground/maestro/captions.yaml
```
