# MentraOS Manager Guidelines

RULES:
READ: ../mintlify-docs/os-devs/contributing/mentraos-manager-guidelines.mdx

## Overview

MentraOS Manager is a React Native app built with Expo and expo-router for file-based routing. The app was recently migrated from vanilla React Native to Expo.

## Build and Test Commands

### Development

- Start dev server: `bun start` (expo start --dev-client)
- Run on Android: `bun android` (expo run:android)
- Run on iOS: `bun ios` (expo run:ios)
- Setup ADB port forwarding: `bun adb`

### Building

- Build Android release APK: `bun build:android:release`
- Build AAB for Google Play: `bun build:google:play` (generates signed AAB only)
- Upload to Google Play: `bun upload:google:play` (builds AAB and uploads to Play Store)
- Build iOS archive: `bun build:ios:archive`

### Versioning

The user-facing app version (`CFBundleShortVersionString` on iOS,
`versionName` on Android) comes from `EXPO_PUBLIC_MENTRAOS_VERSION` in
`.env`. **The CI staging-builds workflow uses `.env.example`** (it does
`cp .env.example .env` on each runner), so:

- Bump `EXPO_PUBLIC_MENTRAOS_VERSION` in **both `.env` and `.env.example`**
  whenever starting work on a new version (e.g. 2.10 → 2.11). Otherwise
  CI keeps building the old train and TestFlight will reject with
  "train is closed for new build submissions" once that train is approved.
- The build number (`CFBundleVersion` / `versionCode`) is derived at
  build time from wall-clock seconds — see `mobile/scripts/build-number.mjs`.
  Nothing to bump manually; just don't downgrade `EXPO_PUBLIC_MENTRAOS_VERSION`.

### Testing

- Run tests: `bun test`
- Run tests in watch mode: `bun test:watch`
- Run single test: `bun test -- -t "test name"`
- Run Maestro E2E tests: `bun test:maestro`
- Lint code: `bun lint`
- Type check: `bun compile`
- Bluetooth SDK Android compile check: `../scripts/check-android-compile.sh bluetooth-sdk`

`modules/bluetooth-sdk/android` contains the SDK Android sources, but local
Gradle checks should run through the generated `mobile/android` project via the
repo script above. The script installs mobile dependencies when needed, runs
`bun expo prebuild --platform android`, uses the generated Gradle wrapper, and
passes `-PmentraPublicSdk=true` for the SDK module check.

## Project Setup

### From Scratch (Android)

```bash
bun install
bun android
```

### From Scratch (iOS)

```bash
bun install
bun ios
```

## Architecture Changes (Expo Migration)

### Key Changes

- **Routing**: File-based routing with expo-router (no more src/screens folder)
- **Imports**: Absolute paths instead of relative paths
- **Components**: Categorized into folders or misc/ folder
- **Theming**: Components use theme/themed from useAppTheme() hook, but strongly prefer to use tailwindcss
- **Entry Point**: expo-router/entry instead of traditional App.js

### File Structure

- `src/app/` - File-based routes (expo-router)
- `src/components/` - Reusable components (categorized by feature)
- `src/contexts/` - React Context providers
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions and helpers, always put new utilities into an existing folder or make one
- `src/theme/` - Theme configuration and styling

## Code Style

- TypeScript with React Native and Expo
- Imports: Absolute paths, group by external/internal, alphabetize within groups
- Formatting: Prettier with single quotes, no bracket spacing, trailing commas
- Components: Functional components with React hooks
- Naming: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables
- Navigation: File-based routing with expo-router (React Navigation under the hood)
- State management: Context API for app-wide state
- Error handling: use typesafe-ts (see RestComms.ts for examples)

## Working with MentraOS

- Backend server required for local testing
- Port forwarding: `bun adb` (sets up tcp:9090, tcp:3000, tcp:9001, tcp:8081)
- Bluetooth functionality for glasses pairing
- **Background timers on Android are always native** (no env var, dev and
  release alike). If startup shows a "Background timers unavailable" alert or
  red-boxes in the nitro module, your dev client's native binary predates
  `react-native-nitro-bg-timer` — rebuild with `bun android`. Until then,
  backgrounded behavior is broken: engine timers freeze and local miniapps
  (captions, wake words) stop whenever the app isn't foregrounded.

## Mapbox tokens (two different credentials!)

- **Public token (`pk.…`)** — runtime map rendering. Lives in `.env` as
  `EXPO_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`. Safe to ship in the app.
- **Downloads token (`sk.…`, secret scope `Downloads:Read`)** — build time only,
  authenticates downloading Mapbox's binary SDKs. Never shipped. It must live in:
  - `~/.netrc` for iOS (SPM reads it): `machine api.mapbox.com login mapbox password sk.…`
  - `MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_TOKEN` env var for Android (Gradle maven repo auth)
  - GitHub Actions secret `MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_TOKEN` for CI

Gotchas learned the hard way (2026-07):

- Most Mapbox package downloads are unauthenticated, but the **Navigation SDK
  binaries (`dash-native`) return 401 without a valid token from an account with
  an active (billing-enabled) subscription** — "an active subscription is
  required" means add a payment method + activate Navigation, not a token issue.
- Secret token values are shown **once** at creation. Store them in the company
  password manager, under a **shared org Mapbox account** — a departed
  employee's personal account once held our only working token.

## Sentry Configuration (iOS)

Sentry source map and debug symbol uploads are **disabled by default** to prevent build failures when the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` is not configured.

### Enabling Sentry Uploads

To enable Sentry uploads for production builds:

1. Obtain your Sentry auth token from https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/
2. Add the token to your environment:
   - **Option 1**: Add to `ios/.xcode.env.local` (recommended for local development):
     ```bash
     export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token_here
     export SENTRY_DISABLE_AUTO_UPLOAD=false
     ```
   - **Option 2**: Set as environment variable in your CI/CD pipeline:
     ```bash
     export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token_here
     export SENTRY_DISABLE_AUTO_UPLOAD=false
     ```

### Disabling Sentry Uploads

Sentry uploads are disabled by default. To explicitly disable them:

```bash
export SENTRY_DISABLE_AUTO_UPLOAD=true
```

This is already set in `ios/.xcode.env`, so builds will work without Sentry credentials.

## Development Environment Setup

### Recommended Platform

- **macOS or Linux** (recommended) - Windows has known issues with this project
- Use **nvm** (Node Version Manager) to manage Node.js versions
- **Node.js 20.x** (recommended version)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ^18.18.0 || >=20.0.0 (20.x recommended)
- nvm (Node Version Manager - highly recommended)
- bun (preferred package manager)
- Android Studio (for Android development)
- Xcode (for iOS development on macOS)
- EAS CLI for building

### For nvm Users (Node.js version manager)

If you're using nvm and getting "command 'node' not found" errors during Android builds:

1. Run the fix script: `./scripts/old/fix-react-native-symlinks.sh`
2. This creates symlinks that prevent React Native libraries from executing node commands during build

This is needed because:

- Android Studio doesn't inherit shell PATH from nvm
- Some React Native libraries try to execute `node` commands during Gradle configuration
- The symlinks provide the React Native path directly, avoiding node command execution
