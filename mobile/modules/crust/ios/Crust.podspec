  # specification"). The SPM package is wired into the Xcode project by
  # mobile/plugins/mapbox-nav-ios.ts at prebuild, and its MapboxMaps dependency
  # + Downloads-token auth come from the @rnmapbox/maps config plugin. So there
  # is intentionally NO `s.dependency 'MapboxNavigationCore'` here.
