/**
 * `@mentra/engine/internal` — the migration-era runtime surface.
 *
 * Raw zustand stores and service singletons that the Mentra app's host-side
 * services (and the `@/stores/*` / `@/utils/*` shims) still reach into while
 * the typed `engine` facades grow. Everything here either mutates runtime
 * state or exposes a store/service directly, so none of it belongs on the
 * OEM-facing `@mentra/engine` main entry: new host code should read/act
 * through `engine.*` instead.
 *
 * Every `/internal` import in mobile/src is counted (report-only) by
 * scripts/check-mobile-runtime-boundary.sh; the burn-down plan is
 * cloud-v2/docs/issues/020-glasses-status-boundary/integration-review.md §D.
 * Types that only describe these internal surfaces live here with them;
 * types host UI renders with stay on the main entry.
