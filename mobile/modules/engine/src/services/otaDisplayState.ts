/**
 * Pure derivation of the OTA progress UI state from the glasses data in the
 * Zustand store plus a couple of genuinely-local inputs. See
 * OtaInstallCoordinator.ts for the state machine that consumes this (the host
 * progress screen renders its snapshot).
 *
 * Legacy shape (WP 8C): old (< 37) ASG builds send `ota_progress`, which the SDK
 * maps to ota_status with sessionId "" and FINISHED→"complete" at ANY phase. For
 * those statuses a download-phase "complete" only means the download finished
 * (the install is still ahead), and an apk install "complete" may be held by the
 * coordinator's settle window — both stay "updating" instead of terminal.
 *
 * Priority-ordered rules (first match wins):
 *   1. errorMsg !== ""                                          -> "failed"
 *   2. BES terminal + connected + sawReconnectEdge             -> "complete"
 *   3. BES terminal (any connection state)                     -> "restarting"
 *      (legacy-shaped BES "complete" counts only in install phase)
 *   4. apkCompletedViaBuildIncrease (legacy build-number port) -> "complete"
 *   5. otaStatus.status === "failed"                           -> "failed"
 *   6. otaStatus.status === "complete" (non-BES)               -> "complete"
 *      (unless legacy-shaped download-complete or held apk settle -> in flight)
 *   7. !connected + legacy in-flight complete (held apk)       -> "updating"
 *   8. !connected + APK step_complete with totalSteps > 1      -> "starting"   (expected reboot)
 *   9. !connected + BES in flight                              -> "restarting" (defensive)
 *   10. !connected                                             -> "disconnected"
 *   11. connected + in_progress | step_complete | legacy in-flight complete -> "updating"
 *   12. fallback                                               -> "starting"
