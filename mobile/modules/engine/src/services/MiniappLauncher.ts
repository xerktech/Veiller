/**
 * MiniappLauncher — headless launch/teardown of a local miniapp's background
 * JS context.
 *
 * This is the one piece of "run a miniapp" that used to live inside the
 * `LocalMiniappView` React component (resolve the bundle → read the manifest →
 * `spawnAndRegister`), triggered only when the Compositor mounted that
 * component on foreground. Pulling it into the runtime means:
 *
 *   - `start()` can actually spawn an app even when nothing foregrounds it
 *     (e.g. a system app launching another miniapp via `session.miniapps`).
 *   - the action broker can wake a stopped target headlessly — no UI at all.
 *   - the dev hot-reload respawn path and the WebView mount path share one
 *     resolve+spawn recipe instead of three copies.
 *
 * The launcher is **headless**: no React, no RN components. The engine-owned
 * MiniappEngine hands it the {@link MentraJSRouter} instance once during
 * engine construction. OEMs embedding the runtime drive miniapp lifecycle
 * through the engine facade and stores, not a separate launcher configure API.
 *
 * Boundary: the launcher owns the **background** context. WebView *rendering*
 * (the UI layer) stays with the host — the launcher just hands back the
 * resolved UI entry so the host can mount its `<WebView>`.
