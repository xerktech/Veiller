 * Crust. Crust gets compile-time visibility via search paths into the shared
 * build-products dir, where SPM drops the .swiftmodule. In a clean archive the

 * module → "error: no such module 'MapboxDirections'" (or NavigationCore/Maps)
 * → ARCHIVE FAILED (exit 65). The race is non-deterministic and the failed
 * partial build still leaves the swiftmodule in DerivedData, so a retry almost
 * always finds it present and succeeds.

 * for any OTHER module is a real, non-transient error (missing dependency,
