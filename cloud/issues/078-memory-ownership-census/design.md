# Design: Memory Ownership Census

## Overview

**What this doc covers:** Implementation plan for the production-safe memory ownership census described in the 078 spec: shared types, estimator helpers, first-wave manager instrumentation, session aggregation, vitals logging, admin endpoint exposure, and CLI support.
**Why this doc exists:** The spec defines the behavior. This doc maps it to concrete files and rollout order so the implementation stays focused and reviewable.
**What you need to know first:** [078 spike](./spike.md) and [078 spec](./spec.md).
**Who should read this:** Whoever implements the PR.

## Shared Types

### `memory-census.ts`

This file should be deliberately tiny. It is a common contract, not a framework.

```typescript
export interface MemoryOwnerStat {
  owner: string;
  scope: "session" | "app-session" | "stream" | "global";
  itemCount: number;
  estimatedBytes: number;
  metadata?: Record<string, string | number | boolean | null>;
}

export interface SessionMemoryCensus {
  estimatedBytes: number;
  owners: MemoryOwnerStat[];
}

export interface MemoryStatsProvider {
  getMemoryStats(): MemoryOwnerStat[];
}
```

## Estimation Helpers

### `memory-estimate.ts`

Keep the helpers dumb and predictable:

```typescript
estimateStringBytes(str?: string | null): number
estimateJsonBytes(value: unknown): number
sumEstimatedBytes<T>(items: T[], fn: (item: T) => number): number
```

Rules:

- always prefer cheap estimators
- never recurse deeply by hand
- never traverse object graphs trying to be “exact”
- use payload size as the proxy

If a structure stores 5,000 transcript segments, the estimate should be dominated by the text and obvious scalar fields. That is good enough.

## Manager-Level Instrumentation

### `TranscriptionManager.ts`

Add `getMemoryStats()`.

#### Owners to emit

- `transcription.history.legacy`
- `transcription.history.{language}`
- `transcription.vad-audio-buffer`
- `transcription.streams`

#### Estimation

For transcript segments:

```typescript
estimatedBytes = sum(
  segments,
  (s) => estimateStringBytes(s.text) + estimateStringBytes(s.resultId) + estimateStringBytes(s.speakerId) + 64, // fixed scalar/object overhead proxy
);
```

For `languageSegments`, emit one owner row per language. This matters because a single language may dominate.

For `vadAudioBuffer`, estimate with total `byteLength`.

### `TranslationManager.ts`

Add `getMemoryStats()`.

#### Owners

- `translation.audio-buffer`
- `translation.streams`

Estimate `audioBuffer` by summing `byteLength`.

### `SonioxTranslationProvider.ts`

Add `getMemoryStats()`.

#### Owners

- `translation.soniox.pending-audio`
- `translation.soniox.utterances.{language}`
- `translation.soniox.latency-measurements`

Utterance estimation should include:

- original token text bytes
- translation token text bytes
- token counts
- small fixed overhead per token

Do not serialize the entire token objects into JSON on every tick. Walk the in-memory arrays directly and count text lengths.

### `AppAudioStreamManager.ts`

Add `getMemoryStats()`.

#### Owners

- `app-audio.pending-chunks`
- `app-audio.streams`

Estimate pending chunks from their `byteLength`.

### `CalendarManager.ts`

Add `getMemoryStats()`.

#### Owner

- `calendar.events`

This should almost always be bounded and small. That is useful: the census will make it trivially exonerable.

### `DashboardManager.ts`

Add `getMemoryStats()`.

#### Owners

- `dashboard.main-content`
- `dashboard.expanded-content`
- `dashboard.always-on-content`
- `dashboard.system-content`

Estimate string content via `estimateStringBytes()`. For `Layout`, use guarded `estimateJsonBytes()`.

### `AppSession.ts`

Add `getMemoryStats()`.

#### Owners

- `app-session.subscription-history`
- `app-session.subscriptions`

Again, likely not dominant, but useful for eliminating suspicion.

## Session Aggregation

### `UserSession.ts`

Add:

```typescript
public getMemoryCensus(): SessionMemoryCensus
```

The method should:

1. build rows for direct session-owned fields
2. call `getMemoryStats()` on managers/providers that implement it
3. flatten everything into one list
4. sum `estimatedBytes`

#### Direct session-owned owners

- `user-session.buffered-audio`
- `user-session.audio-play-request-mapping`
- `user-session.app-health-cache`
- `user-session.loading-apps`

#### Important implementation note

Use feature detection, not hard interfaces everywhere:

```typescript
if ("getMemoryStats" in this.calendarManager) { ... }
```

This keeps the change incremental and avoids needing to thread a formal interface through every class declaration in one PR.

## SystemVitals Aggregation

### `SystemVitalsLogger.ts`

This is the heart of the feature.

#### New internal state

Add a previous-owner snapshot map:

```typescript
private previousOwnerBytes = new Map<string, number>();
```

Per tick:

1. iterate sessions
2. collect `getMemoryCensus()` from each
3. aggregate owner totals:
   - `owner -> estimatedBytes`
   - `owner -> itemCount`
4. compute deltas from `previousOwnerBytes`
5. sort and keep top N
6. update `previousOwnerBytes`

#### Top session derivation

For each session:

- total estimated bytes
- top 3 owners in that session

Then sort sessions descending and keep top 10.

#### New log fields

```typescript
memoryEstimatedSessionBytes;
memoryOwnerCount;
memoryTopOwners;
memoryTopOwnerDeltas;
memoryTopSessions;
```

All complex structures should be JSON strings, same pattern as other vitals fields.

#### Growth warning

Add a small rate-limited helper:

```typescript
private memoryOwnerWarnCooldown = new Map<string, number>();
```

If an owner is both large and still growing, emit `feature: "memory-owner-growth"` no more than once every 10 minutes per owner.

## Admin Endpoint

### `admin.routes.ts`

Extend `/api/admin/memory/now`.

The response already returns process and session information. Add:

- aggregate census
- top sessions
- per-session owner rows

This should be the canonical debugging endpoint for humans and scripts.

## CLI

### `bstack.ts`

Add:

```bash
bstack memory-owners --region us-central --duration 2h
```

Suggested output shape:

```text
🧠 Memory Owners — us-central (last 2 HOUR)

Top owners by size:
owner                               bytes     items
transcription.history.en-US         126 MB    18422
translation.soniox.utterances.es     38 MB     4412

Top owners by growth:
owner                               delta
transcription.history.en-US         +11 MB
translation.audio-buffer            +0 MB
```

This command is intentionally log-based. It does not hit admin endpoints.

## Rollout Order

### Phase 1: Shared plumbing

1. `memory-census.ts`
2. `memory-estimate.ts`
3. `UserSession.getMemoryCensus()`

### Phase 2: Highest-value owners

1. `TranscriptionManager`
2. `TranslationManager`
3. `SonioxTranslationProvider`
4. `AppAudioStreamManager`

### Phase 3: Control owners

1. `CalendarManager`
2. `DashboardManager`
3. `AppSession`

### Phase 4: Surfaces

1. `SystemVitalsLogger`
2. `/api/admin/memory/now`
3. `bstack memory-owners`

## Testing

### Unit-level checks

- each `getMemoryStats()` returns stable owner keys
- zero-data cases return empty or zero rows
- bounded structures report bounded counts
- deltas are correct across consecutive vitals ticks

### Integration checks

- start one session, produce transcripts, verify `transcription.history.*` grows
- stop transcript traffic, wait for prune window, verify growth flattens or shrinks
- create translation activity, verify `translation.soniox.utterances.*`
- confirm `/api/admin/memory/now` includes the same owners seen in logs

### Success criteria

The feature is successful if, after one prod deployment, the next heap-growth investigation can identify one or two concrete owner families without taking manual snapshots first.

## Risks

| Risk                                          | Mitigation                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Too much CPU from estimation                  | Keep estimators shallow and payload-based; only inspect first-wave owners |
| Log bloat                                     | Log only top owners and top sessions, not the full census                 |
| Misleading “exact bytes” interpretation       | Call the field `estimatedBytes` everywhere                                |
| Implementation spread across too many classes | First wave only; expand later if needed                                   |

## Decision Log

| Decision                                           | Alternatives considered                        | Why we chose this                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use per-manager `getMemoryStats()` methods         | One giant introspector in `SystemVitalsLogger` | Ownership belongs with the class that owns the structure.         |
| Estimate payload bytes instead of exact heap bytes | Deep heap walking / exact accounting           | Exactness is not feasible in prod. Ranking and deltas are enough. |
| Expose full detail only on admin endpoint          | Put everything in logs                         | Full census would bloat logs; endpoint is better for drill-down.  |

## Implementation Notes

### What was actually built on the branch

The first implementation pass follows the planned architecture closely:

- `memory-census.ts` provides shared types
- `memory-estimate.ts` provides shallow estimator helpers
- manager-level `getMemoryStats()` exists for the first-wave owners
- `UserSession.getMemoryCensus()` aggregates direct session state plus manager/app-session stats
- `SystemVitalsLogger` emits:
  - `memoryEstimatedSessionBytes`
  - `memoryOwnerCount`
  - `memoryTopOwners`
  - `memoryTopOwnerDeltas`
  - `memoryTopSessions`
- `MemoryTelemetryService` includes per-session `memory` rows plus aggregate `memoryCensus`
- `bstack memory-owners` reads the new `system-vitals` fields

### Additional branch work that was not part of the original design

The implementation branch also includes a follow-up build-hygiene commit that fixes Hono route param narrowing and restores a clean cloud package build. That work is not part of the ownership census itself, but it materially improved reviewability and deployment readiness.

## Design Adjustments After Implementation

### Adjustment 1: Reuse the existing memory snapshot service

Original design:

- describe the admin endpoint extension directly in `admin.routes.ts`

What changed:

- the admin endpoint still lives in `admin.routes.ts`, but the actual census assembly is now folded into `MemoryTelemetryService.getCurrentStats()`

Why:

- it avoids duplicating snapshot assembly logic
- it keeps `/api/admin/memory/now` and any memory-telemetry log snapshots on the same shape

### Adjustment 2: Keep deltas in vitals logs first

Original design:

- expose both aggregate owners and top-owner deltas everywhere

What changed:

- owner deltas are currently logged in `system-vitals`
- `/api/admin/memory/now` currently exposes aggregate owners and top sessions, but not owner deltas

Why:

- this kept the first pass smaller
- it was enough to prove the logging/data-flow path before deciding whether the admin endpoint also needs delta state

### Adjustment 3: Use shallow feature detection instead of threading interfaces broadly

Original design:

- mention `MemoryStatsProvider`

What changed:

- the implementation relies on shallow `typeof provider.getMemoryStats === "function"` checks in the aggregation path

Why:

- it kept the rollout incremental
- it avoided widening the type surface across many session-owned classes in a single pass

## Audit-Driven Concerns

These came out of the first code audit and should inform the next implementation pass.

### 1. Growth alert attribution is weaker than intended

Current design gap:

- `SystemVitalsLogger` tracks aggregate owner deltas correctly
- but the associated `userId` on `memory-owner-growth` is currently the largest current holder, not the session that actually grew most recently

Impact:

- the alert can point engineers at the wrong session during an incident

### 2. Alert thresholds are semantically misleading

Current design gap:

- a very large owner can still emit a warning that reads like "growth" even when its current delta is tiny

Impact:

- higher log noise
- lower trust in the new forensic signal

### 3. Transcript-history owners were removed by issue 098

Current state:

- cloud-side transcript history is no longer retained (see `cloud/issues/098-kill-transcript-history/spike.md`)
- the transcription census now reports only live in-flight structures (VAD audio buffer, active streams)
- the previous English-history undercounting concern is moot because no transcript history is stored

### 4. Some estimators may be too expensive for steady-state prod use

Current design gap:

- dashboard layout content is estimated via guarded JSON serialization

Impact:

- acceptable for a first pass
- but worth profiling before deployment because 078 should not meaningfully worsen allocation churn

## Recommended Next Pass

Before first deploy, the next implementation pass should:

1. make `memory-owner-growth` mean real positive growth
2. add true per-session owner-delta attribution
3. review and, if needed, simplify expensive estimators

## Traceability

Relevant local commits on the implementation branch:

- `5f79e9ed0` — initial 078 implementation
- `a7dee4042` — route/build cleanup needed to restore a clean cloud build
