# Spec: Cloud Pod Event-Loop Stall Cascade — Phase 1 Observability (Revised)

## Overview

**What this doc covers:** The exact behavior changes that ship in the first PR for issue 102. Phase 1 is **observability only** — no behavior changes, no fixes. The goal is to land enough instrumentation that one more crash cycle gives us definitive answers about the trigger and the specific audio substage that monopolizes the loop. Phase 2 (the actual fix) will be specified in a separate PR after Phase 1 data lands.

**Why this doc exists:** Three prior diagnoses of these crashes were confidently wrong (see [spike.md](./spike.md)). The fourth would likely also be wrong without disambiguating data. Spending one cycle on instrumentation before designing the fix is strictly faster than shipping a guess that turns out to address nothing.

**What you need to know first:**

- [spike.md](./spike.md) — original investigation and evidence
- [spike-independent-2026-04-23.md](./spike-independent-2026-04-23.md) — second independent investigation that found UDP/audio continued running while HTTP/timers were starved (the failure is event-loop _monopolization_, not freeze)
- [implementation-review-2026-04-23.md](./implementation-review-2026-04-23.md) — Codex's review of the original Phase 1 draft. This spec incorporates all of its blocking and non-blocking points.

**Who should read this:** PR reviewers. Cloud engineers who will analyze the next crash with the new logs.

## The Problem in 30 Seconds

us-central is crashing daily. The most recent crash (2026-04-23 23:34 UTC, restart #5) had:

- An 80.7s `event-loop-gap` log (timer expected at 1s, fired 80.7s late)
- Almost all op_total during that window in `op_audioProcessing_ms`
- HTTP request logs went silent for ~80s while UDP/audio logs continued
- ~96 UDP packets/sec processed pod-wide during the starved window
- ~10 mic-active sessions; no single-user storm

This is event-loop _monopolization_ by UDP/audio, not a complete freeze. K8s liveness on `/livez` times out (because HTTP can't be scheduled), pod is killed.

The existing telemetry cannot answer:

- Which audio substage burns the time (LC3 decode, app fan-out, transcription feed, translation feed, microphone update)?
- What pod-level UDP load corresponds to the dangerous regime?
- When did the cascade _start_ (the gap log timestamp is the recovery moment)?

Phase 1 instruments to answer all three.

## Spec

### S1. Slow UDP audio handler / batch duration log

**File:** `cloud/packages/cloud/src/services/udp/UdpAudioServer.ts`

**Before:** `handleAudioPacket` wraps its for-loop with `operationTimers.addTiming("audioProcessing", ...)` which only records cumulative wall-time across all calls in a 30s vitals window. Individual call durations are not visible.

**After:** Same outer cumulative timer (preserved for vitals), plus an inline check: when one **handler invocation** (which processes a batch of 1+ packets from the reorder buffer) takes longer than `SLOW_AUDIO_CALL_MS` (default 50ms), log a structured warning.

```json
{
  feature: "slow-audio-call",
  durationMs: <number>,
  packetsToProcess: <length>,    // batch size; 1 in normal operation, larger after reorder-buffer flush
  userIdHash: <number>,
  activeSessions: <count>,
  rssMB: <number>,
}
```

Note: the timer brackets one handler invocation (the for-loop over the reorder buffer's flushed packets), **not one packet**. `packetsToProcess` is the batch size so investigators can distinguish "one expensive packet" from "many ordinary packets in a flushed batch."

50ms threshold rationale: steady-state op_audioProcessing is ~400ms / 30s ÷ ~3500 calls ≈ 115μs per call. 50ms is ~400× normal — clear outlier without being so tight that it floods logs in steady state.

**Net effect:** answers questions like "is one packet pathologically slow?" (high duration, low packetsToProcess) vs "is the reorder buffer flushing big batches?" (high duration, high packetsToProcess).

### S2. Audio substage timings inside `processAudioData`

**File:** `cloud/packages/cloud/src/services/session/AudioManager.ts`

**Before:** `processAudioData` is one black box. We know the cumulative time but not which of LC3 decode, fan-out, transcription feed, translation feed, or microphone update consumes it.

**After:** Insert per-substage timers inside `processAudioData`. Two outputs per substage:

1. **Cumulative timer** added to `operationTimers` so vitals emits `op_audio_<stage>_ms` per 30s window:
   - `op_audio_lc3Decode_ms` (only emits when audioFormat=lc3)
   - `op_audio_appFanout_ms`
   - `op_audio_transcriptionFeed_ms`
   - `op_audio_translationFeed_ms`
   - `op_audio_microphoneUpdate_ms`

2. **Outlier warning**: when any single substage call exceeds `SLOW_AUDIO_STAGE_MS` (default 10ms), log:
   ```json
   {
     feature: "slow-audio-stage",
     stage: "lc3Decode" | "appFanout" | "transcriptionFeed" | "translationFeed" | "microphoneUpdate",
     durationMs: <number>,
     userIdHash: <number>,    // privacy-preserving correlation key
     bytes: <buffer length>,
   }
   ```

The 10ms per-substage threshold is conservative: each substage is sub-millisecond in steady state. A 10ms substage call is ~10× normal — caught early, not so tight as to flood.

**Net effect:** the next crash answers "which substage burns the time" by reading op*audio*\*\_ms in vitals, and "which calls were the worst" by reading slow-audio-stage warnings. This is the highest-value addition — it directly determines what Phase 2 fixes.

### S3. Slow audio fan-out warning (with correlation key)

**File:** `cloud/packages/cloud/src/services/session/AudioManager.ts`

**Before:** No fan-out instrumentation.

**After:** Wrap `relayAudioToApps` with a timer; warn when slow OR fan-out is high:

```json
{
  feature: "slow-audio-fanout",
  durationMs: <number>,
  subscribers: <length>,
  bytes: <buffer length>,
  userIdHash: <number>,    // matches S1 and S2 keys for cross-log correlation
}
```

Thresholds: `SLOW_RELAY_MS = 20`, `FANOUT_WARN = 10` subscribers.

**Net effect:** distinguishes "fan-out blowup" hypothesis (many subs per session OR slow per-sub `connection.send()`). Includes the correlation key explicitly demanded by Codex's review (the original implementation omitted it).

### S4. Heartbeat tick at 500ms with `gapStartedAtMs`

**File:** `cloud/packages/cloud/src/services/metrics/SystemVitalsLogger.ts`

**Before:** Loop-liveness is monitored via the existing 1s/2s gap detector. That misses sub-2s hiccups (which may be the leading edge of a cascade) and its log timestamp is when the timer callback eventually fires — i.e., the _recovery_ moment, not the _trigger_ moment.

**After:** Add a 500ms `setInterval` that records the tick time. When the next tick fires more than `HEARTBEAT_GAP_THRESHOLD_MS` (default 1000ms) late, log:

```json
{
  feature: "heartbeat-gap",
  gapMs: <elapsed - HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS>,
  expectedMs: 500,
  actualMs: <elapsed>,
  gapStartedAtMs: <Date.now() - elapsed>,    // approximate trigger time, not log time
  rssMB: <number>,
  activeSessions: <count>,
}
```

`gapStartedAtMs` is critical: without it, investigators reading the heartbeat-gap entry will look at logs immediately preceding the **log timestamp** (which are recovery flush logs), not logs preceding the **trigger** (which are what caused the cascade). With `gapStartedAtMs`, the query for "what was happening at trigger time" is correct.

**Net effect:** finer trigger-moment resolution + investigators can find the actual leading cause without reading the wrong log window.

### S5. logVitals self-timing

**File:** `cloud/packages/cloud/src/services/metrics/SystemVitalsLogger.ts`

**Before:** `logVitals()` itself isn't timed. If the per-session memory census takes seconds, that IS the trigger and we wouldn't know.

**After:** Wrap `logVitals` body in `performance.now()` brackets. Always log `{feature: "vitals-self-timing", durationMs}` at info level. Warn if duration > `VITALS_SELF_SLOW_MS` (default 500ms).

**Important** (per Codex review): use the session count already captured at the top of `logVitals` for the log payload — do **not** call `UserSession.getAllSessions()` a second time in the finally block. The whole point is to measure logVitals' real cost; adding a second session scan in the measurement path itself adds noise.

**Net effect:** rules vitals-as-trigger in or out without polluting its own measurement.

### S6. Pod-level UDP counters in vitals

**File:** `cloud/packages/cloud/src/services/metrics/SystemVitalsLogger.ts` (read), `cloud/packages/cloud/src/services/udp/UdpAudioServer.ts` (expose)

**Before:** UdpAudioServer's packet counters (`packetsReceived`, `packetsDropped`, etc.) only appear in the periodic "UDP audio stats" log every 100 packets. Hard to correlate with vitals windows.

**After:** Each 30s vitals row includes:

- `udpPacketsReceivedDelta` — packets received this 30s window
- `udpPacketsDroppedDelta` — packets dropped this window
- `udpPacketsDecryptedDelta` — packets decrypted this window
- `udpDecryptionFailuresDelta` — decryption failures this window
- `udpRegisteredSessions` — current count of UDP-registered sessions

Implementation: `UdpAudioServer` exposes `getStatsSnapshot()` returning current counter values + active session count. `SystemVitalsLogger` keeps the previous snapshot and computes the delta each window.

**Net effect:** quantifies the regime where the cascade fires. Per the independent spike, dangerous load was ~96 pkt/s pod-wide with ~70 sessions; Phase 1 confirms or refines that threshold.

### S7. Natural GC observer — REMOVED from Phase 1

**Status:** Cut. Codex tested locally and confirmed Bun's `PerformanceObserver.supportedEntryTypes` returns `["mark","measure","resource"]` — `"gc"` is **not** supported. A Node-style observer would silently emit nothing, which is worse than not having it: post-deploy silence would look like "no natural GC pauses" when it really means "instrumentation is broken in this runtime."

**If we keep an observer at all** (optional): gate it behind a runtime check. If `gc` is not in `supportedEntryTypes`, log `{feature: "natural-gc-unsupported"}` once at startup and don't install. Otherwise install normally. This way the absence of natural-gc data is itself an explicit signal.

**For real natural-GC visibility**, a follow-up needs a Bun/JSC-specific mechanism (e.g., periodic `bun:jsc.heapStats()` snapshots and inferring GC from heap deltas). Out of scope for Phase 1.

### S8. K8s probe widening — separate change, with documented tradeoffs

**File:** Helm/Porter probe configuration (handled outside this PR).

Per Codex's review: probe widening is **not a harmless band-aid**; it changes the user-visible failure mode. Specifically:

- **Liveness** widening (`failureThreshold 15 → 30`, `timeoutSeconds 3 → 10`): pod takes longer to be killed/restarted. Reasonable tradeoff for Phase 1 — gives us survivable window for the cascades we observe today.
- **Readiness** widening: keeps a stalled pod in the LB rotation longer. On single-pod us-central, when readiness fails the user sees a brief nginx 503 (which currently fires the BetterStack incident). When readiness succeeds despite the pod being stalled, the user sees **hung HTTP requests** instead. Both are bad on single-pod; **only multi-pod actually fixes this**.

Recommended approach for Phase 1: **widen liveness only, leave readiness tight.** Then a stalled pod still gets removed from the LB quickly (visible as a 503 burst, monitorable), but doesn't get restarted on every 80s gap (fewer churn cycles to investigate per day).

This change is applied via Porter UI separately from the code PR. Operator should:

1. Land code PR (S1-S6)
2. Verify logs in one quiet region
3. Apply liveness widening to us-central
4. Document explicitly: "we are accepting longer 503 bursts in exchange for fewer restarts; resolve permanently via Phase 2 + multi-pod."

### S9. No actual fix in Phase 1

Explicitly out of scope for this PR:

- UDP backpressure (might be the right fix; we don't know yet)
- `setImmediate` yield in audio drain (same)
- Capping subscribers per session (same)
- Any other behavioral change

Adding any of these without the data could mask the real cause and make Phase 2 diagnosis harder.

### S10. Heap snapshot admin API (bundled infrastructure change)

**File:** `cloud/packages/cloud/src/api/hono/routes/admin.routes.ts`

Not strictly observability for the cascade — but bundled into this PR because it enables on-demand heap captures for the [103 non-session heap growth](../103-non-session-heap-growth/) investigation the existing instrumentation can't answer on its own.

**Before:** `POST /api/admin/memory/heap-snapshot` used a `node:inspector` Session + HeapProfiler addHeapSnapshotChunk streaming dance to produce Chrome-compatible `.heapsnapshot` files. ~35 lines of boilerplate per request.

**After:**

- `POST /api/admin/memory/heap-snapshot` — same contract, implementation is now one line via `v8.writeHeapSnapshot(filePath)`.
- `GET /api/admin/memory/heap-snapshot-v8` — **new**. Streams the snapshot directly to the caller as an `attachment; filename="heap-<ts>.heapsnapshot"` download, so operators can pull a snapshot without shelling into the pod to retrieve the temp file.
- `GET /api/admin/memory/heap-snapshot-bun` — unchanged. Kept for local scripts / Safari-style tooling that want the Bun JSC-format output.

**Self-DoS guard** (added after CodeRabbit 🟠 Major review): both V8-path handlers share a module-level `heapSnapshotInFlight` flag. Concurrent requests return 429 instead of stacking two 2×-heap allocations on top of an already stressed pod. Both handlers carry an explicit WARNING JSDoc instructing operators not to invoke during an active degradation window — `v8.getHeapSnapshot()` and `v8.writeHeapSnapshot()` are synchronous and block the event loop for the full snapshot generation (which is exactly what this PR is investigating). The flag covers the expensive blocking generation phase; post-generation streaming is cheap and concurrent downloads of already-generated snapshot data are fine.

**Why bundle into this PR:** the heap-snapshot endpoint was being used during the same investigation that produced this PR; keeping them separate created review churn without a corresponding benefit.

## Non-Goals

- **Identifying the trigger in this PR.** That happens after Phase 1 lands and one more crash cycle gives us logs.
- **Multi-pod deployment.** Eventual fix via the cloud scaling plan; blocked today by single-pod assumptions in the architecture (see spike.md). This issue stabilizes single-pod _until_ the scaling plan lands.
- **Vertical scaling.** Tactical option that buys headroom without addressing the cascade mechanism. Worth doing in parallel; not a substitute.
- **Replacing pino with sync logger.** Async buffering loses logs near death; nice to fix but not required for this investigation since S4 (heartbeat) gives us the trigger timestamp via `gapStartedAtMs`.
- **Fixing PR #2592's mobile reconnect storm.** Separate workstream (issue 101). Reduces _background_ load but is not a per-crash trigger per spike.md.
- **Working natural-GC observer.** Cut from Phase 1; needs Bun-specific mechanism in a follow-up.

## Testing

### Local

1. `bun run lint` passes
2. `bun run typecheck` passes
3. `bun run test` passes (no behavior changes; existing tests should be unaffected)
4. `bun run dev` boots the cloud locally; verify on startup logs:
   - `vitals-self-timing` (info) appears every ~30s
   - Either "Natural GC observer started" OR "natural-gc-unsupported" (depending on runtime)
   - No `heartbeat-gap` warnings under idle dev (would indicate spurious detection)
   - No `slow-audio-call` / `slow-audio-stage` / `slow-audio-fanout` under idle dev

### Smoke (one quiet region first)

Deploy to us-east (currently 0 sessions). After 30 minutes:

```sql
SELECT JSONExtract(raw,'feature','Nullable(String)') as f, count() as n
FROM remote(t373499_mentracloud_prod_logs)
WHERE dt >= now() - INTERVAL 30 MINUTE
  AND JSONExtract(raw,'region','Nullable(String)')='us-east'
  AND JSONExtract(raw,'feature','Nullable(String)') IN
    ('vitals-self-timing','heartbeat-gap','slow-audio-call','slow-audio-stage',
     'slow-audio-fanout','natural-gc','natural-gc-unsupported')
GROUP BY f ORDER BY n DESC
```

Expected:

- `vitals-self-timing` ≈ 60 entries (one per 30s, 30 min)
- `heartbeat-gap` ≈ 0
- `slow-audio-call` / `slow-audio-stage` / `slow-audio-fanout` ≈ 0
- Either `natural-gc` (if Bun version supports) OR `natural-gc-unsupported` (one entry at startup)

If anything spurious fires under steady state, tune thresholds in a follow-up before rolling to us-central.

### Acceptance after one us-central crash

Query the 90 seconds before the trigger time (`gapStartedAtMs` from the heartbeat log):

```sql
-- Replace <TRIGGER_TIME> with the gapStartedAtMs from the heartbeat-gap log
SELECT dt, JSONExtract(raw,'feature','Nullable(String)') AS feat,
            JSONExtract(raw,'stage','Nullable(String)') AS stage,
            JSONExtract(raw,'durationMs','Nullable(Float64)') AS ms,
            JSONExtract(raw,'gapMs','Nullable(Float64)') AS gap,
            JSONExtract(raw,'gapStartedAtMs','Nullable(Int64)') AS gap_start,
            JSONExtract(raw,'packetsToProcess','Nullable(Int32)') AS pkts,
            JSONExtract(raw,'subscribers','Nullable(Int32)') AS subs,
            JSONExtract(raw,'userIdHash','Nullable(Int64)') AS uid_hash
FROM remote(t373499_mentracloud_prod_logs)
WHERE dt >= '<TRIGGER_TIME-90s>' AND dt <= '<TRIGGER_TIME+5s>'
  AND JSONExtract(raw,'region','Nullable(String)')='us-central'
  AND JSONExtract(raw,'feature','Nullable(String)') IN
    ('heartbeat-gap','slow-audio-call','slow-audio-stage','slow-audio-fanout',
     'vitals-self-timing','event-loop-gap')
ORDER BY dt
```

Use the results to answer:

1. **Trigger moment** (S4): the first `heartbeat-gap` entry's `gapStartedAtMs` tells us when. What was logged in the 5-10s before that timestamp?
2. **Which substage** (S2): what does `slow-audio-stage` show? Are entries dominated by one stage (`lc3Decode`, `appFanout`, `transcriptionFeed`, etc.)? What does op*audio*\*\_ms show in the post-recovery vitals row?
3. **Cascade vs pathological** (S1): many `slow-audio-call` entries with low `packetsToProcess` and moderate durations? Or one with multi-second duration? Or any with very high `packetsToProcess` (reorder-buffer flush)?
4. **Fan-out** (S3): any `slow-audio-fanout` entries with `subscribers > 10` near the trigger? Same `userIdHash` as a `slow-audio-call`?
5. **UDP load** (S6): what was `udpPacketsReceivedDelta` and `udpRegisteredSessions` in the vitals window before the cascade?
6. **Vitals as trigger** (S5): any `vitals-self-timing` entries > 500ms in the 60s before the trigger?

Each answered question narrows Phase 2's scope. After one crash cycle, we should be able to point to a specific substage + load condition and design the actual fix.
