# Pod Crash

## Trigger

BetterStack Uptime alert: `prod.augmentos.cloud/health` returning 503, 502, timeout, or 521. Or Porter dashboard showing "Non-zero exit code" / container restart.

## Quick Check (30 seconds)

```bash
bstack health
```

Look at the `uptime` column. If a region shows low uptime (< 5 minutes) while others show hours, that region just crashed and restarted.

## Diagnose (2-5 minutes)

### Step 1: What was the exit code?

Check Porter dashboard → Deployments tab → look for "Non-zero exit code" events.

Or via CLI:

```bash
porter kubectl --cluster <CLUSTER_ID> -- describe pod -n default -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=cloud-prod-cloud" | grep -A8 "Last State"
```

| Exit Code | Meaning                             | Next Step                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **137**   | SIGKILL — Kubernetes killed the pod | Go to "Exit 137" below        |
| **1**     | Unhandled exception — code bug      | Go to "Exit 1" below          |
| **0**     | Clean shutdown — likely a deploy    | Check if a deploy was running |

### Step 1b: Get the crash timeline

```bash
bstack crash-timeline --region <REGION>
```

This gives you a unified timeline of GC probes, event loop gaps, slow queries, health timing, and system vitals leading up to the crash. It's the single most useful command for understanding what happened before a kill.

Look for:

- GC duration spikes (>100ms) right before the crash
- Event loop gaps correlating with the kill time
- MongoDB slow queries (>1000ms) blocking the event loop
- RSS/heap climbing steadily toward the kill

If the timeline shows a clear pattern, you may not need Steps 2-4.

### Step 2: Exit 137 — Why did Kubernetes kill it?

Check for OOM kills:

```bash
porter kubectl --cluster <CLUSTER_ID> -- get events -n default --sort-by=.lastTimestamp | grep -i "oom\|kill\|unhealthy\|liveness"
```

Check the vitals leading up to the crash:

```bash
bstack memory --region <REGION> --duration 1h
bstack gc --region <REGION> --duration 1h
bstack gaps --region <REGION> --duration 1h
```

| Signal                               | What it means                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| RSS climbing steadily → crash        | Memory leak. Check if `@logtail/pino` was re-enabled or a new transport added. See issue 067.              |
| Event loop gap detected before crash | GC freeze or blocking operation. Check `gc-probe` times — if >100ms, heap is too large.                    |
| No gaps, RSS stable, still killed    | Liveness probe failure. Check if `/livez` is the probe target (not `/health`). Check `health-timing` logs. |
| OOMKilling event in kubectl          | Container exceeded 4096MB memory limit. Check for massive heap or external memory.                         |

### Step 3: Exit 1 — What threw?

Check Porter's container logs for the stack trace:

```bash
porter kubectl --cluster <CLUSTER_ID> -- logs -n default -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=cloud-prod-cloud" --previous --tail=50
```

Look for `error:` followed by a stack trace. Common patterns:

| Error                                                  | Cause                                                           | Fix                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Cannot track resources on a disposed ResourceTracker` | Race condition: async operation completes after session dispose | Fixed in issue 068. Should not recur — global handler catches it now.                         |
| `Soniox WebSocket connection timeout`                  | Soniox API unreachable, unhandled rejection                     | Fixed in issue 070. Global `unhandledRejection` handler prevents crash.                       |
| Any `unhandledRejection`                               | A promise rejected without a `.catch()`                         | Check BetterStack for `feature="unhandled-rejection"`. File a bug for the specific call site. |

### Step 4: Check if it's Cloudflare, not us

If the BetterStack status code is **521**:

```bash
bstack health
```

If all regions show high uptime and sessions > 0, the server is fine. 521 = Cloudflare couldn't reach the origin. Check:

- [Cloudflare Status](https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/)
- Azure status for the cluster's region
- Whether the incident auto-resolved within 5 minutes (typical for network blips)

See issue 072 for a documented example.

## Fix

### Memory leak (exit 137, RSS climbing)

First, check what's consuming memory:

```bash
bstack memory-owners --region <REGION>
```

This shows top memory owners by size, growth rate, and per-session breakdown — without needing a heap snapshot. Look for owners that are growing over time (check the "Top owners by growth" section).

If a specific owner is growing (e.g., `transcription.history`, `calendar.events`, `app-session.subscriptions`), you know where to look in the code.

1. Check if the logging transport changed — the `@logtail/pino` transport caused 15 MB/min heap growth (issue 067)
2. Check `disposedSessionsPendingGC` in system-vitals — if > 0, sessions are leaking
3. Take a heap snapshot if the pod is still alive: `analyze-heap.ts live --host=<REGION_HOST>`

### Unhandled rejection (exit 1)

1. The global handler (issue 070) should prevent this now — check BetterStack for `feature="unhandled-rejection"`
2. If you find one, file a bug for the specific call site and add a `.catch()` handler
3. The server stays alive — the individual operation fails but other users are unaffected

### Liveness probe failure (exit 137, no OOM, no gaps)

1. Check if liveness probe is on `/livez` (lightweight) not `/health` (heavy):
   ```bash
   porter kubectl --cluster <CLUSTER_ID> -- describe pod -n default -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=cloud-prod-cloud" | grep -i liveness
   ```
2. If it's on `/health`, update via Porter dashboard → Services → Health Checks → Advanced → Liveness → `/livez`
3. Check `health-timing` logs for slow `/health` responses:
   ```bash
   bstack sql "SELECT dt, JSONExtract(raw, 'durationMs', 'Nullable(Float64)') as ms FROM remote(t373499_mentracloud_prod_logs) WHERE dt >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR AND JSONExtract(raw, 'feature', 'Nullable(String)') = 'health-timing' AND JSONExtract(raw, 'region', 'Nullable(String)') = '<REGION>' ORDER BY ms DESC LIMIT 10"
   ```

### Cloudflare 521

No action needed. Monitor for auto-resolution (typically 3-5 minutes). If it persists > 10 minutes, check Cloudflare and Azure status pages.

## Verify

After the pod restarts:

```bash
bstack health
```

All regions should show `ok` status. Check that:

- Sessions are reconnecting (count climbing back up)
- RSS and heap are at baseline levels for the session count
- No new crashes in the next 10 minutes

```bash
bstack diagnostics --region <REGION> --duration 10m
```

```bash
bstack memory-owners --region <REGION>
```

Check that no owner is growing unboundedly.

Verify zero event loop gaps and GC probes within range.

## Prevent

| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Heap growth → 137       | Logs go through Vector, not in-process transport. Monitor with `bstack memory`.            |
| GC freeze → 137         | Keep heap under 400MB. Distribute traffic via Cloudflare LB to reduce per-region sessions. |
| Unhandled rejection → 1 | Global handler catches all. Monitor `feature="unhandled-rejection"` in weekly error audit. |
| Liveness probe → 137    | Use `/livez` for liveness (zero computation). `/health` for readiness only.                |

## Tips & Tricks (Lessons Learned)

### Getting credentials

SRE credentials (BetterStack, admin JWT) are in Doppler project `mentra-sre`:

```bash
# Run any bstack command with SRE credentials injected
doppler run --project mentra-sre --config dev -- bstack health
doppler run --project mentra-sre --config dev -- bstack incidents --limit 10

# Or export for a session
export BETTERSTACK_USERNAME=$(doppler secrets get BETTERSTACK_USERNAME --project mentra-sre --config dev --plain)
export BETTERSTACK_PASSWORD=$(doppler secrets get BETTERSTACK_PASSWORD --project mentra-sre --config dev --plain)
export BETTERSTACK_API_TOKEN=$(doppler secrets get BETTERSTACK_API_TOKEN --project mentra-sre --config dev --plain)
export MENTRA_ADMIN_JWT=$(doppler secrets get MENTRA_ADMIN_JWT --project mentra-sre --config dev --plain)
```

Cloud runtime secrets (MONGO_URL, SONIOX_API_KEY, etc.) are in Doppler project `mentraos-cloud` — configs: `dev`, `dev_debug`, `staging`, `prod_central-us`, etc. **Don't put SRE tokens in the cloud project.**

### BetterStack log table gotchas

- **Hot storage** (`remote(t373499_mentracloud_prod_logs)`) only has the last few minutes of data. If you're investigating something older, you get zero rows.
- **Historical/S3 storage** (`s3Cluster(primary, t373499_mentracloud_prod_s3)`) has everything but is slower (~3-5s per query) and requires `WHERE _row_type = 1` for log rows.
- **Dev/debug logs** go to `remote(t373499_augmentos_logs)` (the dev source), NOT the prod source.
- The `json` column exists in DESCRIBE but you can't use `json.field` dot notation. Use `JSONExtractString(raw, 'field')` instead.
- Pino fields: `level` is a string ("error"/"warn"/"info"), `message` (not `msg` — Vector renames it), `service`, `region`, `feature`, `userId`.

### BetterStack query patterns that work

```sql
-- Errors for a specific user (last 15 min, hot storage)
SELECT dt, JSONExtractString(raw, 'level') as lvl,
       JSONExtractString(raw, 'message') as message,
       JSONExtractString(raw, 'service') as svc
FROM remote(t373499_augmentos_logs)
WHERE raw LIKE '%isaiahballah%'
  AND JSONExtractString(raw, 'level') IN ('error', 'warn')
  AND dt > now() - INTERVAL 15 MINUTE
ORDER BY dt DESC LIMIT 20

-- System vitals over time (historical, for a specific region)
SELECT toStartOfHour(dt) as hour,
       avg(JSONExtractFloat(raw, 'rssMB')) as rss,
       avg(JSONExtractInt(raw, 'activeSessions')) as sessions,
       avg(JSONExtractInt(raw, 'disposedSessionsPendingGC')) as leaked
FROM s3Cluster(primary, t373499_mentracloud_prod_s3)
WHERE _row_type = 1
  AND JSONExtractString(raw, 'feature') = 'system-vitals'
  AND JSONExtractString(raw, 'region') = 'france'
  AND dt > now() - INTERVAL 16 HOUR
GROUP BY hour ORDER BY hour ASC

-- Raw log snippet (when you don't know the field names)
SELECT dt, substring(raw, 1, 300) as snippet
FROM remote(t373499_augmentos_logs)
WHERE raw LIKE '%keyword%' AND dt > now() - INTERVAL 5 MINUTE
ORDER BY dt DESC LIMIT 5
```

### Debug environment has no logs?

The debug cloud needs `LOG_STDOUT_JSON=true` to output JSON that Vector can parse. Without it, pino-pretty outputs human-readable text and Vector ignores it. This is set in `porter.yaml` as of issue 074. If a new environment has no logs in BetterStack, check this first.

Vector is already deployed on cluster 4689 (DaemonSet in `betterstack` namespace) and filters for `cloud-debug-cloud` containers. No additional Vector install needed.

### When you can't see logs, use kubectl directly

```bash
# Find the pod
porter kubectl --cluster 4689 -- get pods -n default | grep debug

# Tail logs (last 100 lines, grep for your keyword)
porter kubectl --cluster 4689 -- logs -n default <POD_NAME> --tail=100 | grep -i "error\|timeout\|captions"

# Live follow
porter kubectl --cluster 4689 -- logs -n default <POD_NAME> -f | grep -i error
```

### Heap snapshot analysis

**WARNING: Taking a heap snapshot on a loaded server doubles memory usage temporarily. On a server at 400MB+ with many sessions, this WILL cause OOM.** Only take snapshots on low-traffic environments or right after a restart when memory is low.

```bash
# Fetch a Bun heap snapshot (saves as JSON, loadable in Chrome DevTools Memory tab)
doppler run --project mentra-sre --config dev -- \
  bun run packages/cloud/src/scripts/analyze-heap.ts fetch \
  --host=uscentralapi.mentra.glass --out=.heap/

# Analyze object counts
doppler run --project mentra-sre --config dev -- \
  bun run packages/cloud/src/scripts/analyze-heap.ts snapshot \
  --file=.heap/uscentralapi-TIMESTAMP.json

# Live memory tracking (polls /api/admin/memory/now every 30s)
doppler run --project mentra-sre --config dev -- \
  bun run packages/cloud/src/scripts/analyze-heap.ts live \
  --host=franceapi.mentra.glass --interval=10 --duration=300
```

Key things to look for in the snapshot:

- `UserSession` count vs `activeSessions` from health endpoint — difference = phantom sessions
- `Timeout` count — should be ~20× active sessions. Much higher = leaked timers
- All manager types (DashboardManager, DeviceManager, etc.) should equal UserSession count

### Timer leak investigation process

If `disposedSessionsPendingGC` is climbing and GC is freeing 0MB:

1. **Confirm the pattern**: check `disposedSessionsPendingGC` over time in system-vitals. If it climbs from 0 to 5+ over hours, sessions are being retained.
2. **Take a heap snapshot** (on a low-traffic env) and check object counts — UserSession count should match activeSessions.
3. **Audit timers**: `grep -rn "setInterval\|setTimeout" cloud/packages/cloud/src/services/session/ --include="*.ts"` — for each timer, verify it's stored in a variable AND cleared in the owning class's `dispose()` method.
4. **Red flags**:
   - `setTimeout(() => ..., N)` with no variable assignment = untracked, can't be cancelled
   - `setInterval` in a class whose `dispose()` doesn't `clearInterval` it
   - Module-level Maps/Sets that hold closures capturing session references
   - Recursive `setTimeout(fn, 100)` polling with no disposed guard
   - Closures that capture `this` (the session) without checking `this.disposed`
5. **Fix pattern**: store timer in a variable, clear in `dispose()`, add `if (this.disposed) return` guard in callbacks.

### Pre-push build verification

Always run before pushing to avoid CI failures:

```bash
cd cloud && bun run ci
```

This runs the same build sequence as `Dockerfile.porter` locally in ~7 seconds: types → display-utils → sdk → utils → cloud. If it passes, CI will pass.

### Maintain this runbook

After every investigation, add what you learned:

- New query patterns that worked
- Tools/credentials that were hard to find
- Failure modes you discovered
- Things that took multiple attempts to figure out
- Environment-specific gotchas (debug vs prod differences)
