/**
 * AppAudioStreamManager — per-user manager for audio output streaming.
 *
 * Follows the same pattern as AudioManager, TranscriptionManager, etc.:
 * - One instance per UserSession (state is isolated per user)
 * - Constructed in UserSession constructor, disposed in UserSession.dispose()
 * - ZERO global/static state
 *
 * ## Auto-reconnect design
 *
 * The SDK developer creates a stream, writes audio chunks whenever they have
 * them, and calls end() when done. Gaps of any duration between writes are
 * fine — the developer never thinks about phone connectivity.
 *
 * Behind the scenes, the phone plays audio via an HTTP chunked GET to the
 * relay URL. If no data arrives for a while (conversational gap), ExoPlayer
 * closes the HTTP connection. That's fine — when the SDK writes new audio:
 *
 *   1. Cloud buffers the chunks
 *   2. Cloud creates a fresh TransformStream (new readable for the phone)
 *   3. Cloud sends AUDIO_PLAY_REQUEST to the phone (via the glasses WS)
 *   4. Phone does HTTP GET to the same relay URL
 *   5. Cloud flushes the buffer into the new stream and resumes piping
 *
 * The stream URL is stable for its entire lifetime. The phone can reconnect
 * to it any number of times. The SDK never knows or cares.
 *
 * Flow:
 *   1. SDK sends AUDIO_STREAM_START → handler calls this.createStream()
 *   2. SDK sends WS binary frames (streamId + MP3 data) → handler calls this.writeToStream()
 *   3. Phone GETs /api/audio/stream/:userId/:streamId → route calls claimStream()
 *   4. Phone disconnects (gap) → writeToStream detects it, buffers, triggers reconnect
 *   5. Phone GETs same URL again → route calls claimStream() again → buffer flushed
 *   6. SDK sends AUDIO_STREAM_END → handler calls this.endStream()
 *
 * The cloud does ZERO transcoding. It just pipes bytes. If the SDK sends MP3,
 * the phone gets MP3.
 *
 * See: cloud/issues/041-sdk-audio-output-streaming/
