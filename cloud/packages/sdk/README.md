# @mentra/sdk

Build apps for MentraOS smart glasses.

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { MiniAppServer } from "@mentra/sdk";

const app = new MiniAppServer({
  packageName: "com.example.myapp",
  apiKey: process.env.API_KEY!,
  port: 3000,
});

app.onSession((session) => {
  session.transcription.on((data) => {
    session.display.showTextWall(data.text);
  });
});

await app.start();
```

## Session Managers

| Manager       | Access                  | What it does                          |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Transcription | `session.transcription` | Real-time speech-to-text              |
| Translation   | `session.translation`   | Real-time translation                 |
| Display       | `session.display`       | Show text and graphics on the glasses |
| Camera        | `session.camera`        | Take photos and stream video          |
| Speaker       | `session.speaker`       | Play audio and text-to-speech         |
| Mic           | `session.mic`           | Raw audio input and voice activity detection |
| Device        | `session.device`        | Hardware state, battery, connection, events |
| Phone         | `session.phone`         | Notifications, calendar, phone battery |
| Location      | `session.location`      | GPS coordinates                       |
| Storage       | `session.storage`       | Persistent key-value storage          |
| Permissions   | `session.permissions`   | Check app permissions at runtime      |
| LED           | `session.led`           | Control the LED light                 |
| Dashboard     | `session.dashboard`     | Write to the system dashboard view    |
| Time          | `session.time`          | Timezone-aware time utilities         |

### Manual shutter

`await session.camera.takePhoto({ exposureTimeNs: 8_333_333 })` sets sensor exposure time in **nanoseconds** for that shot only. It is **not** saved as a camera preference. Omit the field, or pass an invalid / non-positive value, for normal auto exposure. Unsupported hardware falls back to auto exposure on the glasses.

### Text capture

`await session.camera.takePhoto({ mode: "text" })` captures at maximum source quality and, on supported glasses, crops around readable text before delivery. Omit `mode`, or use `"photo"`, for a normal full-frame photo.

## Migrating from v2?

See the [migration guide](https://docs.mentra.glass/app-devs/migration/overview). Your existing code still works — v3 includes a compatibility layer.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later) or Bun
- Basic TypeScript knowledge

## Getting Started

The quickest way to get started is using our example app. This guide assumes you have a pair of [compatible smart glasses](https://mentra.glass/os) connected to a phone running the [MentraOS app](https://mentra.glass/install).

### Install MentraOS on your phone

Download MentraOS from [Mentra.glass/install](https://mentra.glass/install)

### Set up ngrok

We are going to use ngrok to expose your local app to the internet. This is useful for development, but when you're ready to go live, you'll want to deploy to a cloud service.

1. [Install ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/)
2. Create an ngrok account
3. [Set up a static address/URL in the ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/)

- Make sure you run the `ngrok config add-authtoken <your_authtoken>` line.
- Make sure you select `Static Domain`, then generate a static domain.

### Register your app with MentraOS

![MentraOS Console](https://imagedelivery.net/nrc8B2Lk8UIoyW7fY8uHVg/560e34ff-c3e6-4e1a-1c4e-a0780e4fcd00/small)

1. Navigate to [console.mentra.glass](https://console.mentra.glass/)
2. Click "Sign In" and log in with the same account you're using for MentraOS
3. Click "Create App"
4. Set a unique package name like `com.yourName.yourAppName`
5. For "Public URL", enter your ngrok static URL
6. In the edit app screen, add the microphone permission. See the [Permissions](https://docs.mentra.glass/permissions) guide for details.

> This automatically installs the app for your user. For other people to test the app (including others in your organization), they need to install the app. Get the app install link from the app edit page under the `Share with Testers` section.

### Get your app running

1. [Install bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)
2. Create a new repo from the template using the `Use this template` dropdown in the upper right of [the example app repository](https://github.com/Mentra-Community/MentraOS-Cloud-Example-App) or the following command:

   ```bash
   gh repo create --template Mentra-Community/MentraOS-Cloud-Example-App
   ```

   ![Create repo from template](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c10e14e8-2dc5-4dfa-adac-dd334c1b73a5)

   **Note:** If you want a more in-depth example (recommended for those who've already completed this quickstart), you can use the [Extended Example](https://github.com/Mentra-Community/MentraOS-Extended-Example-App) which includes app settings support.

3. Clone your new repo locally:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   ```
4. Navigate to your repo directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd <your-repo-name>
   bun install
   ```
5. Set up your environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the example:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Edit the `.env` file with your app details:
     ```
     PORT=3000
     PACKAGE_NAME=com.yourName.yourAppName
     MENTRAOS_API_KEY=your_api_key_from_console
     ```
   - Make sure the `PACKAGE_NAME` matches what you registered in the MentraOS Console
   - Get your `API_KEY` from the MentraOS Developer Console
6. Run your app:
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```
7. Expose your app to the internet with ngrok:
   ```bash
   ngrok http --url=<YOUR_NGROK_URL_HERE> 3000
   ```
   Note: `3000` is the port. It must match what is in the app config. If you changed it to `8080`, use `8080` for ngrok instead.

> After making changes to your app code or restarting your server, you may need to restart your app inside the MentraOS phone app.
